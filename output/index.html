    <p id="p1"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/this-one-email-explains-apple/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew Panzarino writing at TechCrunch</a> breaks down an email message between Steve Jobs, Bertrand Serlet, Scott Forstall, and others that documents the moment the App Store was born. Here&rsquo;s the message:</p>
<div class="media-wrapper" id="div2">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Bertrand Serlet to Steve Jobs: &ldquo;Fine, let&rsquo;s enable Cocoa Touch apps&rdquo;</p>
<p>October 2, 2007&nbsp;<a href="https://t.co/9aTxmjgkRS" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/9aTxmjgkRS</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Internal Tech Emails (@TechEmails) <a href="https://twitter.com/TechEmails/status/1400270458608664577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 3, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p></div>
<p id="p3">The email captures an important moment in Apple&rsquo;s history, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/this-one-email-explains-apple/" rel="noopener noreferrer">as Panzarino explains</a>, it&rsquo;s also an important lesson in effective leadership:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote4"><p>
  All in all, this exchange is a wildly important bit of ephemera that underpins the entire app ecosystem era and an explosive growth phase for Internet technology. And it&rsquo;s also an encapsulation of the kind of environment that has made Apple an effective and brutally efficient company for so many years.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p5">It&rsquo;s also fascinating to learn how soon after the iPhone&rsquo;s debut the call was made to let third-party apps onto the platform:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote6"><p>
  Though there has been plenty of established documentation of Steve being reluctant about allowing third-party apps on iPhone, this email establishes an official timeline for when the decision was not only made but essentially fully formed. And it&rsquo;s much earlier than the apocryphal discussion about when the call was made. This is just weeks after the first hacky third-party attempts had made their way to iPhone and just under two months since the first&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.iconfactory.com/2018/03/a-lot-can-happen-in-a-decade/" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone jailbreak toolchain</a>&nbsp;appeared.&nbsp;
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p7">Apple is far larger today than it was in 2007, but it was by no means small then either. The sort of ruthlessly efficient decision-making on display in Serlet and Jobs&rsquo; interaction is a lot easier for startups with a handful of employees, which makes it notable for a company of Apple&rsquo;s size in 2007.</p>

<p id="p2"><a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-bolsters-airtag-privacy-measures-to-offer-android-detector-app-later-this-year/" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNET reports</a> that Apple is adjusting the time within which they sound an alert when separated from their owners and adding ways to alert people when AirTags and third-party Find My network-enabled items are nearby.</p>
<p id="p3">Initially, AirTags were set to play a sound three days after they were separated from their owners. Now, the device will play a warning beep somewhere between 8 and 24 hours. Apple is also creating an Android app to allow owners of Android phones and devices to know if an AirTag or Find My network device is planted on them.</p>
<p id="p4">AirTags launched last month with numerous privacy protections baked into the device and related software, noting at the time that they expected to make adjustments along the way. With a few weeks of real-world use by customers and investigations by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/05/05/apple-airtags-stalking/" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Washington Post</a> and others, today&rsquo;s changes are a positive step toward ensuring that AirTags can only be used for their intended purpose: tracking belongings, not people.</p>
<p id="p5">The latest changes are being rolled out now and will be applied to AirTags when they are near an iPhone. <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-bolsters-airtag-privacy-measures-to-offer-android-detector-app-later-this-year/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple told CNET</a> that it will have more details on the planned Android app later this year.</p>

<p id="p2">I don&rsquo;t track my time because I enjoy starting and stopping timers; I do it because, over the long haul, it provides valuable insight into how I&rsquo;m spending my time. As useful as it is to have data on how much a project or task takes or how much time a task consumes relative to other things I do, the act of tracking itself can be tedious, which is why it can be so easy to fall out of the habit of doing it.</p>
<p id="p3">The reason I&rsquo;ve used <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/timery-for-toggl/id1425368544" rel="noopener noreferrer">Timery</a>, the time tracking app for <a href="https://toggl.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toggl</a>, on my iPhone and iPad since it was released, is because of developer Joe Hribar&rsquo;s attention to making it as easy as possible to track your time without a lot of fuss. Features like saved timers, widgets, keyboard shortcuts, and Shortcuts actions for automating timers have made the app a delight to use since version 1.0.</p>
<p id="p4">In fact, the Timery experience has been so good that I used it even though it had no Mac app, which is something I rarely do with apps I use every day. However, with the release of version 1.2 of Timery today, I no longer need to use a different time tracking app on my Mac because Timery has been released as a Mac Catalyst app, complete with all the features Timery users already know and love from iPhone and iPad versions. Today&rsquo;s update to Timery isn&rsquo;t just a treat for Mac users, though. Version 1.2 also packs in a long list of new keyboard shortcuts and settings for all users, making this one of the biggest updates since the app was launched.</p>

<p id="p7">In creating a Mac Catalyst version of Timery, the iPad version of the app had to evolve too, with a lefthand sidebar instead of a tab bar at the bottom of the screen. On the iPad, the sidebar can be collapsed and includes Saved Timers and Time Entries, plus a separate section for Toggl Settings that can be folded to hide its individual subsections. Besides the sidebar, the iPad version&rsquo;s design hasn&rsquo;t changed appreciably, and the iPhone version is the same.</p>
<p id="p8">If you&rsquo;ve used Timery on an iPhone or iPad before, you&rsquo;ll be right at home using the Mac version. The app works with both free and paid Toggl accounts. Free users can track time based on projects and tags, while paid users can further refine tracking using Toggl&rsquo;s task system. Unlike some Mac Catalyst apps, Timery for Mac makes extensive use of the macOS menu system, as well as keyboard shortcuts. Although the app doesn&rsquo;t include a traditional preference window, it&rsquo;s still one of the best Mac Catalyst apps I&rsquo;ve seen, offering the full Timery experience in a way that is comfortable and familiar to use on the Mac.</p>
<p id="p9">You&rsquo;ll find the same system of pre-defined Saved Timers in Timery for the Mac, as well as a chronological list of previously-logged items in the Time Entries section where you can create one-off timers and restart, edit, and delete existing ones. The app also includes extensive Shortcuts support on the iPhone and iPad and widgets on all platforms to access saved timers, monitor your current time entry, and review your total time tracked. If you&rsquo;re new to Timery, which <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/macstories-selects-2019-recognizing-the-best-apps-of-the-year/#best-new-app" rel="noopener noreferrer">we named the Best New App</a> as part of the 2019 MacStories Selects Awards, be sure to check out our <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/timery-for-toggl-the-macstories-review/" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous</a> <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/timery-for-toggl-updated-with-shortcut-parameter-support-and-a-refreshed-design/" rel="noopener noreferrer">coverage</a> for all <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/timery-debuts-powerful-time-tracking-widgets-for-ios-14/" rel="noopener noreferrer">the details</a>.</p>
<p id="p10">Timery already had great support for external keyboards, but with version 1.2, the app has taken that support to an all-new level, which I&rsquo;ve found I appreciate the most on the Mac. When I work on my iPad, I often tap Timery&rsquo;s Project or Tag entries to add them to a timer. On the Mac, doing the equivalent with a trackpad or mouse feels like a heavier interaction. Perhaps that&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m usually moving from one typing-centric task to another on the Mac, but whatever the reason, the new keyboard shortcuts and other settings added to version 1.2 of Timery have made starting timers with just the keyboard incredibly easy.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="Timery has granular options that let you control exactly when its description field is selected." src="https://cdn.macstories.net/ivborw0kggoaaaansuheugaaclaaaaeacayaaac7j4iiaaaacxbiwxmaabylaaawjqfjuitwaaalgmluwhrytuw6y29tlmfkb2jl-1622583529307.png" /><p class="image-caption">Timery has granular options that let you control exactly when its description field is selected.</p></div>
<p id="p12">Saved timers and the ability to restart a timer with a swipe gesture from the app&rsquo;s list of logged entries are great ways to start a new timer, but Timery&rsquo;s new option to offer suggestions from a timer&rsquo;s description field is my favorite way to start a timer now. There&rsquo;s also a new option in Timery&rsquo;s settings that puts the cursor&rsquo;s focus in the description field by default. Add to that the app&rsquo;s keyboard shortcut for initiating a new timer, and the whole process is incredibly fast. It might not seem like much at first, but if you&rsquo;re moving from one task to another throughout the day, being able to get a timer started with minimal effort means not breaking your concentration or abandoning time tracking out of frustration.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="Timery suggests saved and recent timers as you type in the description field." src="https://cdn.macstories.net/screen-shot-2021-06-01-at-4-32-58-pm-1622583290458.png" /><p class="image-caption">Timery suggests saved and recent timers as you type in the description field.</p></div>
<p id="p14">The process for starting a new timer is usually just three fast keystrokes:</p>
<ul id="ul15"><li>&#8984;-N to compose a new timer</li>
<li>A few quick taps of the arrow keys to pick a saved or recent timer and Return to select it</li>
<li>&#8984;-Return to start the new timer</li>
</ul><p id="p16">That&rsquo;s it. The linchpin to the system is the automatic selection of the description field, which can be turned on in Timery&rsquo;s settings, plus the list of suggested timers.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="Two of my four pages of Timery keyboard shortcuts." src="https://cdn.macstories.net/image-1622583717538.png" /><p class="image-caption">Two of my four pages of Timery keyboard shortcuts.</p></div>
<p id="p18">There are many, many more new keyboard shortcuts for navigating Timery&rsquo;s UI and accessing and editing timers too. The app now offers keyboard shortcuts for up to 30 saved timers, which is far more than the dozen or so I&rsquo;ve created. Timery also includes new keyboard shortcuts for accessing each field of the currently-running timer, which allows for quick edits.</p>
<p id="p19">There&rsquo;s a grab bag of other new features worth mentioning. For instance, there are new settings for rounding time entries up, down, or to the nearest whole increment for a wide range of time increments. Rounding isn&rsquo;t a feature I need, but I expect it will be handy for anyone who bills their time in specific chunks of time. Rounding has also been added as a parameter to the Shortcuts action for stopping timers, and the app supports multi-windowing on the iPad now too.</p>
<hr id="hr20" /><p id="p21">Version 1.2 of Timery is a bit of a sleeper release. On the surface, not much has changed on the iPhone or iPad. However, if you spend a little time exploring the new keyboard shortcuts and settings, incorporating them into your workflow, you&rsquo;ll quickly find that the update substantially increases your efficiency. Coupled with the all-new Mac version, which is a big deal for anyone who works on a Mac and iPad regularly, the latest Timery update is its biggest update yet.</p>
<p id="p22">I&rsquo;d still like to see reports added to Timery in the future, but I&rsquo;m glad the Mac was addressed first. Time tracking is the sort of activity that needs to exist everywhere to be most effective. I&rsquo;ve spent the past couple of years using Toggl&rsquo;s Mac app, which has improved dramatically in that time, but I&rsquo;m glad that I can now learn one set of keyboard commands and use them across both the iPad and Mac. If the lack of a Mac version of Timery was holding you back, now is a perfect time to give the app a try.</p>
<p id="p23">Timery 1.2, which is a free update, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/timery-for-toggl/id1425368544" rel="noopener noreferrer">is available on the App Store</a>. Some of Timery&rsquo;s features require a subscription to Timery Club, which costs $0.99/month or $9.99/year.</p>

<p id="p2">Vidit Bhargava, the developer behind the excellent dictionary app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lookup-english-dictionary/id872564448" rel="noopener noreferrer">LookUp</a>, has published a compelling design concept on <a href="https://blog.viditb.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pixel Posts</a> for bringing a menu bar to the iPad and modifying how its multitasking works.</p>
<p id="p3">Complex apps like Adobe Illustrator hide functionality behind multiple layers of obscure icons using floating palettes that can be hard to learn. <a href="https://blog.viditb.com/design-concept-menu-bar-for-ipados/" rel="noopener noreferrer">As Bhargava explains</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote4"><p>
  They are powerful utility apps that some how [sic] struggle with providing a simple, easy to use and understand navigation for their actions. Actions are often hidden behind modes, strips of complicated icons or simply not available for the lack of space.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p5">As a result, there&rsquo;s no single location you can go to find all of the functionality an iPad app offers.</p>
<p id="p6">Bhargava makes a good case for a menu system on the iPad, using what he calls an Extended Status Bar that includes an app&rsquo;s menu and a customizable control tray to access OS actions like Spotlight search and shortcuts. In addition to the Extended Status Bar, Bhargava imagines the App Library coming to the dock and the addition of floating windows for apps like Calculator.</p>
<p id="p7">I&rsquo;m not convinced that Apple would adopt a system so similar to macOS, but I think Bhargava&rsquo;s on the right track. As more complex apps are brought to the iPad, the lack of a universal way to organize their features means users have to learn a new system for every app, which hinders pro app adoption. If Apple brought Final Cut Pro or Xcode to the iPad, I think its engineers would quickly feel the same pain points with which other developers of pro apps are already grappling.</p>

    <div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/image-1622575109937.png" /><p class="image-caption"></p></div>
<p id="p2">I&rsquo;ve long considered <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/homerun-2-for-homekit/id1527725746" rel="noopener noreferrer">HomeRun</a> by Aaron Pearce a must-have app if you&rsquo;re into HomeKit automation. With version 2, which is available for the iPhone and iPad and is out today, HomeRun adds all-new ways to access HomeKit scenes with in-app grids and Home Screen widgets, along with an updated Apple Watch complication editor. Although the initial setup process can be a bit laborious, investing some time in a setup on multiple devices pays off, allowing you to trigger scenes in many more ways than is possible with the Home app.</p>
<p id="p3"><!--more--></p>
<p id="p4">The two features I&rsquo;ve found the most useful day-to-day are the new Home Screen widgets and grids, both of which are set up independently of each other. Widgets come in three sizes: small, medium, and large. The small widget includes one action with an icon and label, the medium fits up to six actions with icons and no labels, and the large widget holds up to 15 actions with icons and no labels. To set up a custom widget, go to HomeRun&rsquo;s Widget tab, and tap the plus button at the top of the screen to pick a widget size and open HomeRun&rsquo;s Create Widget view. From here, you can name your widget, add items to its grid, and choose whether tapping the widget opens HomeRun or closes it immediately.</p>
<p id="p5">Immediately closing a widget is a clever trick to simulate widget interactivity. Widgets don&rsquo;t support interactions like triggering HomeKit scenes. However, by closing HomeRun immediately after activating a scene, the effect closely resembles interactivity flashing the app briefly but returning you to the Home Screen so quickly that it almost feels as though you never left it. It&rsquo;s a neat trick that we&rsquo;ve seen used by <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/using-soors-widgets-and-magic-mixes/" rel="noopener noreferrer">music apps like Soor</a>, and one I&rsquo;ve turned on for all my HomeRun widgets.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="I'm using three small HomeRun widgets in a stack in the top right corner of my first Home Screen." src="https://cdn.macstories.net/image-1622577116443.png" /><p class="image-caption">I&rsquo;m using three small HomeRun widgets in a stack in the top right corner of my first Home Screen.</p></div>
<p id="p7">Currently, I&rsquo;m using three small HomeRun widgets on my first Home Screen. One widget dims my living room lights for watching TV in the evening, another toggles the lights in my studio, and the third turns off all the lights in my house for those occasions when I go to bed but don&rsquo;t recall whether I&rsquo;ve left a light on somewhere.</p>
<p id="p8">I&rsquo;m using small widgets because I like having a label associated with each action. All three scenes control lights, and having the text alongside the icons I&rsquo;ve picked for each is a nice reminder of what each does. Unfortunately, the buttons on the medium and large widgets don&rsquo;t support text labels, which I&rsquo;d love to see added in a future update.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="I'm using two grids of HomeKit actions currently." src="https://cdn.macstories.net/image-1622576138640.png" /><p class="image-caption">I&rsquo;m using two grids of HomeKit actions currently.</p></div>
<p id="p10">Grids are a flexible new feature added to HomeRun 2 that allows you to set up multiple pages of buttons that trigger HomeKit scenes. A grid can be defined any way you want. For example, you could create grids for different homes, rooms, activities, or time of day, populating each with a collection of scene-triggering buttons that makes sense with that context.</p>
<p id="p11">Each grid&rsquo;s buttons can be rearranged by dragging and dropping them to reorder buttons and place them side-by-side. I found placing buttons side-by-side a little tricky at times, but I appreciate the space-saving flexibility the feature enables. Once you&rsquo;ve set up multiple grids, you can access them by swiping horizontally between each, just like you can swipe between rooms in the Home app. Alternatively, you can switch grids by tapping on the button in the top left corner of the screen. If you have lots of HomeKit scenes, you&rsquo;ll want to give grids a try because it&rsquo;s a fantastic way to organize them.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="The updated complication editor UI." src="https://cdn.macstories.net/image-1622575883913.png" /><p class="image-caption">The updated complication editor UI.</p></div>
<p id="p13">The iPhone version of HomeRun has added an updated Watch complication editor too. The tab walks you through picking the type of complication you want and then creating and scheduling it. The editor UI uses a clock metaphor for scheduling multiple complications that will appear on your chosen watch face throughout the day at appointed hours. You add actions by tapping the plus button in the middle of the clock and setting it up, much like you would a widget or grid action. With a new complication action in place, you can use the drag handles around the edge of the clock UI to schedule the hours that it will appear on your watch face. The new UI looks terrific, but I still found it a little hard to get the hang of adding multiple actions to a single complication.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="My three watch complications occupy the top left corner of my Infograph Modular watch face." src="https://cdn.macstories.net/image-1622575824489.png" /><p class="image-caption">My three watch complications occupy the top left corner of my Infograph Modular watch face.</p></div>
<p id="p15">Ultimately, I arrived at a setup that gives me access to a complication that toggles my studio lights most of the day. In the evening, the complication switches to an action that turns on my bedside lamp for reading and then a button for turning off our first-floor lights. I ran into some visual glitches in the complications editor, such as the icons jumping outside of their designated slots or disappearing altogether. However, overall, the editor is an improvement even though there are minor bugs to work out.</p>
<p id="p16">One area that I would like to see improved in a future version of HomeRun is the action setup process. Complications created on your iPhone sync to your Apple Watch, of course, but grids and widgets don&rsquo;t sync between iOS and iPadOS devices. If you use multiple devices, that means you&rsquo;re starting fresh everywhere you want to use HomeRun, which becomes tedious quickly. Besides syncing, though, I&rsquo;d also love HomeRun&rsquo;s buttons to be reusable within the app itself. Buttons in a grid, widgets, and complications all have the same basic setup, requiring the user to pick a color, icon, label, and action. You might not want all your buttons to look exactly the same in every context, but being able to duplicate an existing button that could then be modified would be a big time-saver compared to the current setup.</p>
<p id="p17">That said, I love what Aaron Pearce has done with HomeRun 2. HomeKit scenes are the perfect use case for simple, interactive widgets and work well in stacks. I also appreciate the addition of grids, especially the ability to organize them into different sets. It&rsquo;s just the right amount of extra organization to make the feature more useful for anyone with lots of HomeKit devices but flexible enough to allow users to tailor it to their specific needs.</p>
<p id="p18">HomeRun 2&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/homerun-2-for-homekit/id1527725746" rel="noopener noreferrer">is available in the App Store</a> and is a brand new subscription-based app that also offers a lifetime purchase, which gives users the option of paying $4.99/year or $19.99 one time.</p>

</ul><p id="p10">The selections include a lot of games and entertainment apps, including several Apple Arcade titles, and a mix of apps from smaller developers like CARROT Weather, Craft, Nova, and Pok Pok Playroom as well as bigger publishers. Panic&rsquo;s Nova also stands out from the rest of the finalists as the sole app that is not available in one of Apple&rsquo;s stores.</p>
<p id="p11">I like that Apple has announced the finalists in advance. Winning an ADA is a big achievement for any developer, but it&rsquo;s also nice to know who the finalists are because it, too, is quite an honor among the many apps that could be chosen.</p>

    <div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/apple_wwdc21-swift-student-challenge-winners_hero_06012021-1622550368817.jpg" /><p class="image-caption"></p></div>
<p id="p2"><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/06/apples-wwdc21-swift-student-challenge-winners-code-to-change-the-world/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple has announced</a> the winners of its annual WWDC Swift Student Challenge. This year, the group includes 350 students from 35 countries and regions.</p>
<p id="p3">Susan Prescott, Apple&rsquo;s vice president of Worldwide Developer Relations and Enterprise and Education Marketing <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/06/apples-wwdc21-swift-student-challenge-winners-code-to-change-the-world/" rel="noopener noreferrer">said of this year&rsquo;s participants</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote4"><p>
  Every year, we are inspired by the talent and ingenuity that we see from our Swift Student Challenge applicants. This year, we are incredibly proud that more young women applied and won than ever before, and we are committed to doing everything we can to nurture this progress and reach true gender parity.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p5">Of the many winners this year, Apple chose three sets of winners to spotlight in its press release:</p>
<ul id="ul6"><li>Sisters Gianna and Shannon Yan, whose app Feed Fleet matches volunteers with at-risk people for free grocery during the pandemic</li>
<li>15-year-old Abinaya Dinesh, whose app Gastro at Home helps people with gastrointestinal disorders, access information and resources about their conditions</li>
<li>Damilola Awofisayo, who created TecHacks, a non-profit with the mission of &ldquo;creating a supportive environment for girls everywhere to create, problem-solve, and showcase their talents alongside like-minded females to compete and work with.&rdquo; Awofisayo is also working on an American Sign Language app</li>
</ul><p id="p7">Apple&rsquo;s WWDC Student Challenge has changed over the years, most recently focusing on the Swift programming language, but it&rsquo;s been a mainstay of the conference for years now. The competition is one of my favorite parts of the conference, too, having had one of my own kids participate in it in 2013 and seeing how it inspired him to pursue a career as a developer. Since then, I&rsquo;ve had the chance to meet many past winners and cover their apps on MacStories, which has made it clear to me just how big an impact the program has had in many students&rsquo; lives.</p>

The app&rsquo;s scanning engine is fast and accurate, delivering crisp, clear scans on the go using your device&rsquo;s camera or by picking images from the app&rsquo;s system file picker, your photo library, or as part of a custom shortcut.</p>
<p id="p3">The app works with a wide range of documents. From receipts to pages in books, Genius Scan has advanced edge detection that quickly recognizes a page from its background, automatically cropping it and gathering multiple scans into a single PDF for sharing or archiving. Rescanning is easy too. There&rsquo;s no need to rescan an entire document from scratch because Genius Scan lets you delete or replace individual pages with a few taps. It&rsquo;s a workflow that&rsquo;s as intuitive as it is efficient.</p>
<p id="p4">Genius Scan features highly accurate optical character recognition, enabling full-text searching of your scans and the ability to copy the text for use elsewhere. The app also supports machine learning-based file naming, Shortcuts, extensive sharing options, Split View and Slide Over on the iPad, and much more.</p>

Genius Scan Basic is free and fully functional with no watermarks, scanning limits, third-party ads, or tracking. Genius Scan+ unlocks background uploading support to cloud services like Dropbox and Google Drive, OCR, locking the app with Touch ID, PDF encryption, and smart document naming for just $7.99. Also, a Genius Cloud subscription adds document sync and backup for peace of mind for $2.99/month or $29.99/year.</p>
<p id="p6">So <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id377672876?pt=371508&amp;ct=macstories202105&amp;mt=8" rel="noopener noreferrer">download Genius Scan today</a>, to support these independent, honest, privacy-conscious developers and put the App Store&rsquo;s best scanner in your pocket.</p>

<p id="p2">Earlier today, Apple officially opened their <a href="https://www.apple.com/it/retail/viadelcorso/" rel="noopener noreferrer">new flagship retail store</a> in Rome, Italy. Located on the popular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_del_Corso" rel="noopener noreferrer">Via del Corso street</a> in the city&rsquo;s historical center, the new store &ndash; which we previously covered <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-prepares-to-open-its-latest-flagship-store-in-romes-historic-via-del-corso-shopping-district/" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> &ndash; is located in the historic <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palazzo_Marignoli" rel="noopener noreferrer">Palazzo Marignoli</a>, a 19th century building that has been renovated by Apple and painstakingly restored to its former glory.</p>
<p id="p3">I, along with our designer and photographer <a href="https://twitter.com/_silviagatta" rel="noopener noreferrer">Silvia Gatta</a>, was able to visit the Via del Corso store yesterday ahead of its grand opening to the public. Coincidentally, the occasion also marked the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CPWIzOhpppf/" rel="noopener noreferrer">first time</a> Silvia and I were able to visit the center of Rome free of red-zone restrictions since October 2019, when we took <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/iphone-11-pro-in-rome/" rel="noopener noreferrer">an amazing tour of Rome</a> to demonstrate the iPhone 11&rsquo;s camera capabilities before the pandemic hit our country in early 2020.</p>
<p id="p4">Besides the underlying sense of euphoria for seeing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Steps" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spanish Steps</a> again and being around tourists for the first time in nearly 18 months, we came away impressed with what Apple has accomplished with its new Rome retail store. The Via del Corso store is an outstanding exercise in blending Rome&rsquo;s rich architectural history with the modern reality of Apple&rsquo;s computers and wearable devices &ndash; a challenge that the company didn&rsquo;t take upon lightly, and which has, in fact, shaped the overall identity of the Via del Corso store.</p>

</aside><h2 id="palazzo-marignoli-and-caffe-aragno">Palazzo Marignoli and Caff&egrave; Aragno</h2>
<p id="p8">The new Via del Corso store is intrinsically tied to the history of its building, Palazzo Marignoli, which makes this store (the 17th to open in Italy) one of Apple&rsquo;s most ambitious restoration projects to date. Palazzo Marignoli is located in Via del Corso 180 &ndash; a five-minute walk from more widely-known landmarks in the heart of Rome such as the Spanish Steps or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazza_del_Popolo" rel="noopener noreferrer">Piazza del Popolo</a>. Originally constructed in 1873 under the guidance of architect <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvatore_Bianchi_(architetto)" rel="noopener noreferrer">Salvatore Bianchi</a> (who was also responsible for a major redesign of Rome&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roma_Termini_railway_station" rel="noopener noreferrer">Termini railway station</a>), Palazzo Marignoli owes its name to Marquis <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filippo_Marignoli" rel="noopener noreferrer">Filippo Marignoli</a>, who commissioned construction of the residence and whose requirements (such as a ballroom on the upper floor) are still visible today. Years later, the palazzo&rsquo;s facade was torn down to allow for an expansion of Via del Corso and architect <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giulio_Podesti" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giulio Podesti</a> was put in charge of the new project.</p>
<p id="p9">However, before the location in Via del Corso 180 was used for Palazzo Marignoli, it was home to one of Rome&rsquo;s so-called &ldquo;disappeared churches&rdquo; &ndash; in this case, the historic monastery of <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiesa_di_Santa_Maria_Maddalena_delle_Convertite_(Roma)" rel="noopener noreferrer">Santa Maria Maddalena delle Convertite</a>. Rather than hide the palazzo&rsquo;s origins from public view, Apple decided to pay homage to a remnant of the ancient monastery with a courtyard that serves as the green heart of the palazzo, which features tall <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnamomum_camphora" rel="noopener noreferrer">Camphora trees</a> and creates a fantastic contrast between greens and the palazzo&rsquo;s white/gray stone. We didn&rsquo;t use the main entrance, so the courtyard was the first thing we saw; it immediately suggested this store was going to be unlike anything else we&rsquo;d seen in terms of Apple retail presence.</p>

<p id="p12">Most Romans and experts of modern Roman history, however, likely associate Palazzo Marignoli with <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caff%C3%A8_Aragno" rel="noopener noreferrer">Caff&egrave; Aragno</a>, a historic cafe &ndash; one of the two most popular cafes in Rome at the time &ndash; active between 1886 and 1955, which was located inside the palazzo. Due to its central location and close proximity to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palazzo_Montecitorio" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chamber of Deputies</a>, Caff&egrave; Aragno quickly became a popular gathering place for writers, journalists, politicians, actors, and all sorts of artists who used to meet up in the cafe to drink and discuss matters of politics, society, art, and more. <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orio_Vergani" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orio Vergani</a>, a notable Italian sports journalist, referred to the &ldquo;third room&rdquo; of Caff&egrave; Aragno as &ldquo;the sanctum of literature, art, and journalism&rdquo;. Caff&egrave; Aragno was a big deal in its heyday, with a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/656825161021673/posts/1957935297577313/" rel="noopener noreferrer">compelling</a> story full of fascinating, and sometimes weird, anecdotes.</p>
<p id="p13">In doing my research on Caff&egrave; Aragno (which <em>almost</em> included purchasing copies of newspapers from the early 1900s on eBay as well), I came across two stories I <em>have</em> to mention here to provide everyone with some additional context on the importance of this place in Rome&rsquo;s culture and history.</p>
<p id="p14">In 1906, due to the hot climate between anarchists and trade unionists, a bomb (likely a handmade grenade) was thrown into Caff&egrave; Aragno. Frontpages of newspapers such as Il Messaggero (which is still around and offers a public historic archive) <a href="https://cdn.macstories.net/img_0166-1622074723265.jpeg" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirm the event</a>. But an unlikely figure of international caliber can also attest to the explosion at Caff&egrave; Aragno: writer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Joyce" rel="noopener noreferrer">James Joyce</a>, who happened to <a href="https://www.walksinrome.com/blog/plaque-to-james-joyce-via-frattina-rome" rel="noopener noreferrer">live nearby</a> Caff&egrave; Aragno at the time (in Via Frattina); as <a href="https://books.google.it/books?id=pMCJDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1965-IA271&amp;lpg=PA1965-IA271&amp;dq=james+joyce+bomb+aragno+rome&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Cn9QI4mAzl&amp;sig=ACfU3U2imEVn3dOYNriX2J7rDi3qzlA-Ng&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiR7_-nx-LwAhXKK3cKHa3dCb4Q6AEwE3oECDkQAw#v=onepage&amp;q=james%20joyce%20bomb%20aragno%20rome&amp;f=false" rel="noopener noreferrer">he wrote in a letter</a> to his brother <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislaus_Joyce" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stanislaus</a> (Stannie), he &ldquo;felt the house shake&rdquo; and heard people running and yelling &ldquo;Bomba! Bomba!&rdquo; in the streets.</p>
<p id="p15">The second Caff&egrave; Aragno story is, quite possibly, the most Italian thing I&rsquo;m ever going to publish here on MacStories. In 1926, following a series of literary disagreements, while talking inside Caff&egrave; Aragno Italian writer and poet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massimo_Bontempelli" rel="noopener noreferrer">Massimo Bontempelli</a> slapped another famous writer and poet, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Ungaretti" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giuseppe Ungaretti</a>. The slap eventually <a href="https://www.siciliafan.it/duello-a-casa-di-pirandello/" rel="noopener noreferrer">led</a> to an <em>actual sword duel</em> later in the year at the Rome residence of another poet and dramatist, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Pirandello" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luigi Pirandello</a>. Unfortunately for him, Ungaretti lost. (Don&rsquo;t worry, he didn&rsquo;t die in the duel; he only suffered a minor injury on his right forearm. Ungaretti: great at poetry, bad at slapping and sword-dueling, it appears.)</p>
<p id="p16">Now, I&rsquo;m not sharing these stories only because they&rsquo;re odd and amusing (but they <em>really</em> are and I couldn&rsquo;t help myself). My main point here is that, as a citizen of Rome who&rsquo;s interested in the eternal city&rsquo;s history, I was concerned that, in taking over Palazzo Marignoli, Apple was going to swoop in, put up a bunch of computers and displays, and completely disregard the palazzo&rsquo;s history to serve their corporate strategy.</p>
<p id="p17">After all, my concern was justified: after the closure of Caff&egrave; Aragno, the palazzo was used for a series of fast food restaurant chains over the subsequent decades. I connected the dots on this a few days ago: when I was a kid in the late &rsquo;90s, whenever my parents took me to visit Rome we&rsquo;d eat some pizza and fries at this restaurant chain called &lsquo;Spizzico&rsquo; in Via del Corso. Because other parents and teachers responsible for students on school trips had the same idea, the place was always loud, dirty, and smelly. But it was cheap, and the pizza was passable, and it was very central without being a tourist trap, so we kept going there over the years. As I discovered a few days ago, that place was Caff&egrave; Aragno &ndash; the same building Apple has been renovating and restoring for the past few years. I thought that was a fun coincidence.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="Fun fact: Apple and its team of restorers had to deep-clean the facade of Palazzo Marignoli to bring back the original color after years of negligence." src="https://cdn.macstories.net/fullsizerender-1622077914314.jpeg" /><p class="image-caption">Fun fact: Apple and its team of restorers had to deep-clean the facade of Palazzo Marignoli to bring back the original color after years of negligence.</p></div>
<p id="p19">But back to Apple. Here&rsquo;s the great news: not only was the company able to restore Palazzo Marignoli to its former glory, but they also meticulously preserved and revived the artistic heritage of Caff&egrave; Aragno by working with a team of local restorers for the past few years. Apple isn&rsquo;t new to challenging restoration projects (as previously seen with <a href="https://www.apple.com/fr/retail/champs-elysees/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es in Paris</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/retail/regentstreet/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Regent Street in London</a>, and <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/carnegielibrary/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carnegie Library in Washington, D.C.</a>), but the results in the Via del Corso store are simply exquisite. Apple and its teams of restorers were able to revive and restore (in their original location) two long-hidden ceiling paintings that date back to the early 1900s &ndash; <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Fabio_Cipolla" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fabio Cipolla</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dawn&rdquo; and Ettore Ballerini&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dusk&rdquo;. Both paintings are immediately visible by looking up at the massive 6.5-meter tall ceiling in the room where the main entrance is located. The same room features six urban-themed graffiti dating back to 1950 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afro_Basaldella" rel="noopener noreferrer">Afro Basaldella</a>, which have been restored by Apple and incorporated in the room&rsquo;s white walls.</p>
<aside class="pull-quote aligncenter" id="aside20"><blockquote>
<p>Apple is honoring the creativity that once stemmed from Caff&egrave; Aragno and Palazzo Marignoli.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside><p id="p21">The unique combination of tradition and modernity based on the harmonious contrast between old and new &ndash; a recurring theme throughout the whole Via del Corso experience &ndash; is tangible and thoughtful. You&rsquo;re in a palazzo that was built in 1880, looking at paintings from the early 1900s and graffiti from 1950, all while browsing around tables featuring M1 iPad Pros and colorful iMacs. Somehow, it all works together and it&rsquo;s stunning to see in person.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="I don't know if it's intentional, but there's a nice continuum between the restored graffiti and the iMac's line-art screensaver." src="https://cdn.macstories.net/fullsizerender-1622076591900.jpeg" /><p class="image-caption">I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s intentional, but there&rsquo;s a nice continuum between the restored graffiti and the iMac&rsquo;s line-art screensaver.</p></div>

<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="From the main showroom, you can walk to the monumental staircase (pictured in the background), which connects the store to the upper floor." src="https://cdn.macstories.net/fullsizerender-1622076843371.jpeg" /><p class="image-caption">From the main showroom, you can walk to the monumental staircase (pictured in the background), which connects the store to the upper floor.</p></div>
<p id="p27">Unlike the palazzo&rsquo;s former occupants, Apple isn&rsquo;t trying to hide its history: the company is <em>celebrating</em> it and embedding it (and Rome&rsquo;s cultural roots in the process) in its own products and experience. With this store, Apple is telling the story of its products as tools for creativity as much as they&rsquo;re honoring the creativity that once stemmed from Caff&egrave; Aragno and Palazzo Marignoli.</p>
<h2 id="walking-around-a-store-museum">Walking Around a Store-Museum</h2>
<p id="p28">In walking around the Via del Corso store and exploring its upper floor, I think it&rsquo;s easy to feel like you&rsquo;re visiting a museum more than a retail store. The ceilings are tall (roughly three times what you&rsquo;d see in a regular apartment here in Rome), and because Apple used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrara_marble" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carrara marble</a> for detailing work (which has been integrated with the original stone from the 1880s), everything is very bright, polished, and refined. You can tell there&rsquo;s a lot of history to the place that&rsquo;s just as important as the products themselves. From the long colonnade that connects two showrooms (running along the courtyard) to the restored monumental staircase (which dates back to 1888) leading you to the upper floor, it&rsquo;s almost as if the palazzo becomes a meta-product of sorts &ndash; a new type of gathering place that acts as a conduit to the modern Apple experience.</p>

<p id="p34">The large street-level windows let plenty of sunlight into the store, but they also create a sense of continuity between the city of Rome and its bustling Via del Corso and Apple&rsquo;s work on the restored Palazzo Marignoli. Besides its appearance, Palazzo Marignoli as an Apple store feels very different from the restaurant chain it used to be: in the three hours we spent exploring it yesterday, I got the sense that Apple wants, in a way, to give back this place and its history to the city of Rome. From the outside, branding is minimal; sure, you can tell it&rsquo;s an Apple store, but the focus is first and foremost on the location. I can tell you that the <em>exact opposite</em> was true for the former owners of Palazzo Marignoli, who littered the sidewalk and windows with posters, signage, and all sorts of junk that is, unfortunately, all too common for retail companies taking over some of Rome&rsquo;s finest historical buildings.</p>
<p id="p35">The store-museum feeling only grows stronger the more you explore. My personal favorite is the grand staircase, which connects the ground floor to the upper level, where you can find the Genius Bar, Forum, executive boardroom, and a landscaped terrace overlooking the courtyard. Look above the staircase and you&rsquo;ll see a skylight, which was once closed and has now been restored using a modern LED technology that simulates the variation of light throughout the day.</p>

<p id="p44">On the upper floor, what was once the Marquis&rsquo; ballroom is now the Forum, which will be used for <a href="https://www.apple.com/today/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Today at Apple</a> sessions in the future once those in-person activities are allowed again.</p>

This used to be the Marquis&rsquo; ballroom.</p></div>
<p id="p46">My favorite room on the upper floor, however, was the one dedicated to Apple Support and the Genius Bar. Here, a team of conservators managed to restore a geometrically patterned, hand-painted ceiling with golden leaf decorations that overlooks the typical Apple store furniture and a range of iPhone accessories. The ceiling is an incredible sight, and it encapsulates Apple&rsquo;s restoration efforts for Palazzo Marignoli, highlighting, once again, the importance of letting old and new coexist in harmony, complementing each other.</p>

<p id="p51">As Silvia and I walked out the new Via del Corso Apple store yesterday, one thing was clear to both of us: more than the latest iMacs, iPhones, and iPads featured in the store, the most important product Apple is showcasing here is the beautifully restored Palazzo Marignoli.</p>
<aside class="pull-quote aligncenter" id="aside52"><blockquote>

</aside><p id="p53">As someone who&rsquo;s been living in Rome for the past eight years and who&rsquo;s unfortunately familiar with the decay and abandonment of several historical landmarks in the center of the city, I can tell you: it&rsquo;s important to return a place such as Palazzo Marignoli with the long history of Caff&egrave; Aragno back to the city, its citizens, and (hopefully) its returning tourists.</p>
<p id="p54">If you ever needed a perfect example of Apple&rsquo;s favorite mantra &ndash; that they operate at the intersection of technology and liberal arts &ndash; the new Via del Corso store at Palazzo Marignoli in Rome would be it.</p>

<p id="p2">Apple has updated its developer forums in the lead-up to WWDC with several new features. Last year, the developer forums got a complete overhaul just before the annual conference, improving developers&rsquo; ability to ask questions, interact with other developers and Apple engineers, and follow topics that interest them. This year, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=n33tv3lm&amp;1622087642" rel="noopener noreferrer">the company is adding the ability to</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote3">
<ul><li>Post comments on questions or answers to provide context or ask for clarification.</li>
<li>Search for content across multiple tags.</li>
<li>Add and manage favorite tags.</li>
<li>Upload images to your question or answer to provide supporting visual details.</li>
<li>See tag descriptions when choosing tags for your question so you can quickly select the most appropriate ones.</li>
<li>Subscribe to RSS feeds for tags you&rsquo;re interested in.</li>
<li>See your authored and watched content, favorite tags, and trending tags on the newly designed home page.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p id="p4">I expect I&rsquo;ll use the new tagging tools a lot this summer as I work on my macOS review. The developer forums have always been an excellent resource but haven&rsquo;t always been the easiest to navigate. Armed with a collection of tags and RSS feeds delivering updates automatically, I&rsquo;ll be using the forums a lot more than I did in the past. There&rsquo;s still room for improvement, though. For example, as nice as the addition of RSS feeds is, they only apply to individual tags, not search results.</p>

    <p id="p1">Joe Rosensteel has <a href="http://joe-steel.com/2021-05-24-Once-More-With-Feeling.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">an in-depth look at the new Apple TV 4K</a> on his website, Unauthoritative Pronouncements. Joe covers every step of the setup process, the new Siri Remote, and the new Apple TV 4K hardware. He concludes that although there have been substantial improvements in some areas, notably with the Siri Remote, there is a lot of room for improvement, especially for a device that is considerably more expensive than its competition.</p>
<p id="p2">One of my favorite critiques is of the setup process, which does a good job transferring your Apple TV apps to a new device, but leaves users to log into them one by one. It&rsquo;s a frustrating experience that&rsquo;s all too common on more than just the Apple TV. <a href="http://joe-steel.com/2021-05-24-Once-More-With-Feeling.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">As Joe explains</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote3"><p>
  There is still this logical disconnect in this process where I have authorized the Apple TV to log into my Apple ID and access my iCloud data, including data from my existing devices, and iCloud KeyChain, but it can&rsquo;t set up an Apple TV with all my apps and services logged in. I know someone might insist that this is for security, but it absolutely isn&rsquo;t because all this data exists, in iCloud, accessible to anyone who has my unlocked iPhone and Apple TV - which is what is required to just populate empty apps on the screen.</p>
<p>  My login state for these other services should really be stored in iCloud across all Apple devices I own, or with a token authorization system that uses the iPhone in my hand. At the very least, aggregate all of the services I need to log into in one spot for me to do it with Face ID, or Touch ID, opening up the saved password data for each of the entries I need to make.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p4">The new jog wheel ring around the Siri Remote&rsquo;s clickpad <a href="http://joe-steel.com/2021-05-24-Once-More-With-Feeling.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">can be confusing</a> to interact with too, especially because it doesn&rsquo;t work with all third-party apps:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote5"><p>
  What about using it as a jog wheel? Well &hellip; it doesn&rsquo;t work in all circumstances you will expect it to work in. You need to be in an app that supports the feature. YouTube, Hulu, and Disney+ don&rsquo;t support it, for example. In some apps, the wheel moves the position on the timeline forward &hellip; and then backward, even though you&rsquo;ve completed &ldquo;a rotation&rdquo; around the wheel because this isn&rsquo;t really a wheel. It&rsquo;s four directions mapped to a ring that doesn&rsquo;t actually turn. It really breaks the rotation metaphor.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p6">There&rsquo;s a lot more to Joe&rsquo;s review of the latest Apple TV, so be sure to check it out. As someone who consumes video exclusively through an Apple TV, many of these criticisms rang true. I haven&rsquo;t tried the new Apple TV 4K myself, but I did replace my old Siri Remote with the new model, and despite taking a bit to get used to, that one change has been a substantial upgrade.</p>

<p id="p2">MacStories pal Stephen Hackett has published a video on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZzXBTOSdtmOz9_VMYffr4g" rel="noopener noreferrer">512 Pixels YouTube channel</a> comparing the M1 and G3 iMacs. If you follow Stephen&rsquo;s work, you know that he knows a thing or two about Apple&rsquo;s colorful G3 iMacs. In 2016, Stephen acquired <a href="https://512pixels.net/2016/05/all-13-colors/" rel="noopener noreferrer">all 13 colors of the iMac G3</a>, <a href="https://512pixels.net/2017/08/a-new-home-for-the-imacs/" rel="noopener noreferrer">donating them to The Henry Ford Museum</a> in Dearborn, Michigan the following year.<sup id="fnref-66940-1"><a class="jetpack-footnote" href="https://www.macstories.net/feed/#fn-66940-1" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a></sup> The <a href="https://512pixels.net/projects/imacg3/" rel="noopener noreferrer">project</a> spawned several articles, podcast episodes, YouTube videos, and even <a href="https://books.apple.com/us/book/aqua-and-bondi/id1181116653" rel="noopener noreferrer">a book</a>.</p>
<p id="p3">Apple&rsquo;s colorful M1 iMacs began arriving on customers&rsquo; doorsteps at the end of last week, and Stephen got an orange model that he compares to the Tangerine iMac G3. The competition is far from fair given the advances made since the iMac G3&rsquo;s debut in 1998, but it makes for a fun setup to show just how far the iMac has come in the past 23 years.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper" id="div4"></div>
<p id="p5">I&rsquo;m glad Stephen chose the Tangerine iMac G3 and Orange M1 iMac for his video. The two are my favorite colors from both eras and really show off the designs of each well.</p>
<div class="footnotes" id="div6">

I tagged along with Stephen to see his iMac G3s in an exhibit at The Henry Ford Museum during Maker Faire that summer. It was terrific to see those landmark Macs end up in a good home, especially since it&rsquo;s a museum I grew up visiting for grade school field trips. We even got to see the museum&rsquo;s working Apple I as a bonus treat.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.macstories.net/feed/#fnref-66940-1" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8617;&#65038;</a>

    <div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/ivborw0kggoaaaansuheugaac50aaajwcayaaaakgq9xaaaacxbiwxmaaastaaaleweampwyaaam-1621883726799.png" /><p class="image-caption"></p></div>
<p id="p2">First seen in the mind mapping app&rsquo;s Mac version earlier this year, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mindnode-mind-map/id1218718027" rel="noopener noreferrer">MindNode</a> has added an editable outline mode to its iPad and iPhone versions. <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/mindnodes-newly-editable-outline-view-adds-a-terrific-new-dimension-to-the-mind-mapping-apps-mac-version/" rel="noopener noreferrer">I was impressed</a> with MindNode&rsquo;s editable outline mode on the Mac, and I&rsquo;m happy to report that the iPad and iPhone versions are every bit as good. The app&rsquo;s editable outline takes advantage of the iPad and iPhone&rsquo;s unique features to provide the same useful alternative perspective on your mind map that the Mac version offers.</p>
<p id="p3"><!--more--></p>
<p id="p4">Outline mode on the iPad and iPhone will be familiar to anyone who has used the feature on the Mac, but it has been tailored specifically to those devices&rsquo; hardware. Of the two, I prefer the iPad&rsquo;s roomier screen, but the iPhone is a surprisingly good option, notwithstanding its smaller screen, especially for quick on-the-go edits.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="The outline is editable on the iPhone too." src="https://cdn.macstories.net/image-1621863460628.png" /><p class="image-caption">The outline is editable on the iPhone too.</p></div>
<p id="p6">To view a mind map&rsquo;s outline, tap the outline icon in MindNode&rsquo;s tool palette, and on the iPad, the outline slides into view from the side of the screen. The outline can extend the height of the iPad&rsquo;s screen or shrink into a compact panel with a swipe down on its drag handle. The panel can also be moved to either side of the screen, providing lots of layout flexibility onscreen.</p>
<p id="p7">On the iPhone, the experience is usually modal because of the smaller screen size. In portrait mode, the outline view slides up from the bottom occupying the entire view. However, in landscape on the iPhone 12 Pro Max, you can view the outline side-by-side with your mind map, although working that way is a bit cramped.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="You can expand the outline to fill the iPad's screen." src="https://cdn.macstories.net/ivborw0kggoaaaansuheugaac50aaajwcayaaaakgq9xaaaacxbiwxmaaastaaaleweampwyaaam-1621883797932.png" /><p class="image-caption">You can expand the outline to fill the iPad&rsquo;s screen.</p></div>
<p id="p9">Once the outline panel is visible on the iPad, you have a couple of choices. You can work with the outline view open in the panel side-by-side with your mind map, or you can tap the double-arrow button to expand the outline to occupy the entire screen. In either view, the outline is fully interactive.</p>
<p id="p10">On either device, nodes can be dragged around the outline, dropped between sibling notes to rearrange them, or on top of another node to create a new child node relationship. Context menus are supported too, which reveal options to indent, outdent, and show a node in the mind map, as well as cut, copy, paste, or delete it. Indenting and outdenting, along with deleting, are also supported by swiping left and right on nodes of the outline. Outline mode supports external keyboard and trackpad interaction, Scribble with the Apple Pencil, and full-screen viewing on an external display too.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="The outline supports context menus." src="https://cdn.macstories.net/ivborw0kggoaaaansuheugaac50aaajwcayaaaakgq9xaaaacxbiwxmaaastaaaleweampwyaaam-1621883867194.png" /><p class="image-caption">The outline supports context menus.</p></div>
<p id="p12">The ability to show a node in the mind map is particularly handy when you have a large, sprawling mind map. That&rsquo;s not the only design choice that stands out in this update. The outline nodes are color-coded to match the mind map, making it easy to visualize the relationships between the mind map and outline. Each node on the outline is connected by vertical lines that make it easy to tell which nodes are at the same hierarchical level, and sections of the outline can be folded at its parent nodes, which collapses the corresponding sections of the mind map too.</p>
<hr id="hr13" /><p id="p14">In my review of MindNode&rsquo;s Mac update, <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/mindnodes-newly-editable-outline-view-adds-a-terrific-new-dimension-to-the-mind-mapping-apps-mac-version/" rel="noopener noreferrer">I concluded that</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote15"><p>
  IdeasOnCanvas have absolutely nailed the outlining basics with this update. The visual design, display options for the outline and mind map views, and keyboard shortcut implementation work together in perfect concert, making the feature feel natural and the interactions obvious.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p16">That holds equally true on the iPad and iPhone. Having an alternative view for editing provides a valuable second perspective on large mind maps. Combined with the app&rsquo;s many other exceptional features, MindNode is a powerful tool for anyone working on a big project, which is why I plan to use it this summer as I plan my annual macOS review.</p>
<p id="p17">MindNode&rsquo;s editable outline mode <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mindnode-mind-map/id1218718027" rel="noopener noreferrer">is available from the App Store</a> as part of a MindNode Plus subscription, which is an In-App Purchase.</p>

<p id="p2">Apple has released iOS and iPadOS 14.6 today with a handful of new features, including Apple Card Family and Podcasts Subscriptions, along with Updates to AirTags and the Find My app.</p>
<p id="p3"><a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-announces-apple-card-family/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Announced during Apple&rsquo;s spring event</a>, Apple Card Family is now available in iOS 14.6. Up to five people over the age of 13 can share an Apple Card, allowing them to track expenses and manage spending. All family members on an Apple Card will build credit histories, and parents can set spending limits for their children too.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/apple_iphone12-podcasts-codeswitch-theathletic-midnightmiracle_042021-1618944900358.jpeg" /><p class="image-caption"></p></div>
<p id="p5">iOS and iPadOS 14.6 also includes <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-announces-apple-podcasts-subscriptions/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Podcasts Subscriptions</a>, which allows podcasters to offer paid versions of their shows. Shows can be offered as paid-only subscriptions or enhanced versions of free shows that add a combination of bonus features like extended, ad-free, and early-release episodes. The new subscription service is baked directly into the Podcasts app, allowing users to access paid subscriptions alongside free shows.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/apple_airtag-front-and-back-emoji-2up_042021-1618958282681.jpg" /><p class="image-caption"></p></div>
<p id="p7">One of the features of <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-reveals-airtags-for-tracking-personal-items-using-its-find-my-network/" rel="noopener noreferrer">AirTags at launch</a> was the ability to add a phone number to call if a tagged item was lost somewhere. With iOS and iPadOS 14.6, users can add an email address. Also, Apple release notes say that when an AirTag is tapped with an NFC-compatible device, it will show a partially masked phone number.</p>
<p id="p8">Apple has also added the ability to unlock an iPhone for the first time after a restart using their voice, which is a Voice Control feature.</p>
<p id="p9">Not released with the update today is anything related to Spatial Audio or Lossless streaming of Apple Music content, which is not unexpected since Apple previously said <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-announces-spatial-audio-and-lossless-playback-for-apple-music-subscribers-coming-in-june/" rel="noopener noreferrer">the feature is coming in June</a>.</p>

<p id="p2">In June, Apple Music will offer the option of streaming in <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-announces-spatial-audio-and-lossless-playback-for-apple-music-subscribers-coming-in-june/" rel="noopener noreferrer">CD-quality and high-resolution lossless formats</a>. There was <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/airpods-and-homepods-will-not-support-apple-musics-new-lossless-audio/" rel="noopener noreferrer">initial confusion</a> about which Apple devices will support lossless streaming, but the company has clarified things with <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212183" rel="noopener noreferrer">a support document</a>.</p>
<p id="p3">The new support document confirms what was announced earlier this week. Lossless is supported by iPhones, iPads, and Macs using their built-in speakers and wired headphones, receivers, and powered speakers. Lossless audio will stream to AirPods, AirPods Max, and Beats wireless headphones, but it won&rsquo;t be lossless because they rely on Bluetooth, which is inherently lossy.</p>
<p id="p4">Regarding the Lightning to 3.5&nbsp;mm cable for the AirPods Max, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212183" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple&rsquo;s support document says</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote5"><p>
  The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MXK22AM/A/lightning-to-35-mm-audio-cable-12m-white" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lightning to 3.5&nbsp;mm Audio Cable</a>&nbsp;was designed to allow AirPods Max to connect to analog sources for listening to movies and music. AirPods Max can be connected to devices playing Lossless and Hi-Res Lossless recordings with exceptional audio quality. However, given the analog to digital conversion in the cable, the playback will not be completely lossless.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p6">It&rsquo;s also worth noting that Apple&rsquo;s Lightning to 3.5mm adapter that can be used to connect wired headphones to devices only supports up to 24-bit/48&nbsp;kHz lossless audio. A digital-to-analog converter is necessary for 24-bit/192&nbsp;kHz playback.</p>
<p id="p7">Apple says HomePods and HomePod minis will be updated and an unspecified date in the future to support lossless playback, but they don&rsquo;t currently support it.</p>
<p id="p8">It wasn&rsquo;t clear initially which Apple TVs will support lossless streaming. Apple&rsquo;s support document suggests that it&rsquo;s only the Apple TV 4K, connected to a receiver via HDMI, leaving Apple TV HD owners out of luck. Moreover, the Apple TV 4K only supports lossless playback at 24-bit/48&nbsp;kHz. However, the wording of the support document leaves the possibility that a future update may make Hi-Res Lossless available.</p>
<p id="p9">Finally, only Apple Music content supports lossless streaming. iTunes Store content and Apple Music&rsquo;s broadcast radio, Apple Music 1, other live radio content, and music videos will not stream losslessly.</p>

<p id="p2">Apple&rsquo;s Podcasts Subscriptions service is coming soon, and today, the company debuted an affiliate program to help spread the word about the shows that participate in it. <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-announces-apple-podcasts-subscriptions/" rel="noopener noreferrer">As we previously reported</a>, the subscription program will allow podcasters to offer paid versions of their shows. Podcasters can offer paid-only shows or enhanced versions of free shows that add a combination of bonus features, like extended, ad-free, and early-release episodes.</p>
<p id="p3">Today&rsquo;s announcement <a href="https://podcasters.apple.com/support/979-affiliate-program-for-podcasts" rel="noopener noreferrer">adds Podcasts Subscriptions to Apple&rsquo;s existing affiliate programs</a> for iTunes Store content as well as Apple Music, TV+, New+, and Books subscriptions and content. If you <a href="https://apple.co/podcastpartners" rel="noopener noreferrer">apply to the program</a> and are accepted, you&rsquo;ll be given a token that identifies your affiliate account when you publish a link to a paid podcast. When someone subscribes to a show using your link, you&rsquo;ll earn a 50% commission on the first month&rsquo;s subscription fee for any subscriptions signed up within a 30-day window. For example, the new program would mean a $5 payout for a user who signed up for a $10/month subscription. The affiliate program is available to podcaster&rsquo;s offering shows for subscriptions, adding another way for them to earn money from their shows.</p>
<p id="p4">With the exception of apps, which were <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-announces-apps-and-in-app-purchases-will-be-removed-from-its-affiliate-program-october-1st/" rel="noopener noreferrer">removed from Apple&rsquo;s affiliate program in 2018</a>, Apple now offers an affiliate program for all of the subscriptions and content it sells. The success of the App Store ultimately made that affiliate program unnecessary for Apple to continue. However, as a new service, it makes a lot of sense to introduce an affiliate program for Podcasts Subscriptions to help raise its profile among consumers.</p>

<p id="p2">Apple has released a new video in its ongoing &lsquo;Privacy. That&rsquo;s iPhone&rsquo; campaign titled &lsquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/8w4qPUSG17Y" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tracked</a>.&rsquo; The latest spot starts with the lead character purchasing a coffee and then being followed around all day by a growing crowd of people that intrude on his privacy. Back home at the end of the day, the protagonist is prompted by his iPhone to &lsquo;Ask App Not to Track&rsquo; or &lsquo;Allow&rsquo; tracking, and as soon as &lsquo;Ask App Not to Track&rsquo; is chosen, the mob of people crowding his apartment pop like balloons, disappearing in puffs of smoke.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper" id="div3"></div>
<p id="p4">Privacy isn&rsquo;t an easy thing to depict visually, and no doubt, someone will take issue with aspects of the way the video portrays app trackers, but I enjoyed it. The video is entertaining, but it&rsquo;s also useful to anyone who doesn&rsquo;t realize how intrusive cross-app and website tracking can be.</p>
<p id="p5">This isn&rsquo;t the first video released in the series. Late last month, Apple released &lsquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/Ihw_Al4RNno" rel="noopener noreferrer">App Tracking Transparency</a>&rsquo;, which explains how the iOS 14.5 feature works. Earlier this year, the company also released &lsquo;<a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/docs/A_Day_in_the_Life_of_Your_Data.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Day In the Life of Your Data</a>,&rsquo; a case study with real-world examples of what app trackers can do.</p>

<p id="p2">I always look forward to Austin Mann&rsquo;s unique perspective on Apple hardware. His latest review is from Flagstaff, Arizona where he takes Apple&rsquo;s new M1-based iPad Pro through its paces as he processes photos taken at Great Sand Dunes National Park.</p>
<p id="p3"><a href="http://austinmann.com/trek/ipad-pro-m1" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mann cuts right to the chase</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote4"><p>
  As any photographer knows, one of the most time-consuming parts of the photo creation process is culling through thousands of images, making selects, and editing the images. Thanks to the M1 chip, faster internal storage, and a few other improvements, the new iPad Pro with M1 is the fastest image sorting tool I&rsquo;ve ever used.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p5">A great demonstration of the power of the new iPad Pro is the video in Mann&rsquo;s post in which he moves rapidly through a large set of 60+ MB RAW photos. There&rsquo;s absolutely no lag, making the iPad Pro a terrific tool for culling large collections of imported shots.</p>
<p id="p6">Unsurprisingly, Mann also concludes that the iPad Pro&rsquo;s big, bright display and mobile data connection make it an ideal tool for previewing images on a sunny day and staying connected to research photo shoots. However, Mann&rsquo;s wishes for the iPad Pro, like background importing of photos and the ability to connect multiple external storage devices, are precisely the sort of thing that is holding the iPad Pro back from being a more complete solution for photographers and other pro users. Despite the limitations, though, the new iPad Pro looks like a big step up for photographers, which I can&rsquo;t wait to try with my own camera soon.</p>

<p id="p2">My youngest son just finished his junior year in high school, so it&rsquo;s been a while since my kids sat on the floor, absorbed by the toys surrounding them. Still, that was a big part of my life for a long time as a parent, so I think I still have a feel for what my kids would have liked when they were little, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok-pok-playroom/id1550204730" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pok Pok Playroom</a> is definitely one of those things.</p>
<p id="p3"><!--more--></p>
<p id="p4">The types of toys that would capture my kids&rsquo; imaginations when they were younger were things like Thomas the Tank Engine wooden train sets, Lego, art supplies, stuffed animals, and toy cars and trucks. They were the sort of simple toys that encouraged interaction, imagination, and creativity as they built worlds for their animals to live in.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="Explore Pok Pok Playroom's town, where everything is interactive." src="https://cdn.macstories.net/ivborw0kggoaaaansuheugaaclaaaaeacayaaac7j4iiaaaacxbiwxmaabylaaawjqfjuitwaaalgmluwhrytuw6y29tlmfkb2jl-1621505604323.png" /><p class="image-caption">Explore Pok Pok Playroom&rsquo;s town, where everything is interactive.</p></div>
<p id="p6">Pok Pok Playroom, which is available on the iPhone and iPad, fills a similar role. The app includes six colorful toys, which are distinct environments for kids to explore. The app is designed for children 2-6 years old, encouraging open-ended play and discovery in a calm setting that sparks their imaginations.</p>
<p id="p7">Pok Pok Playroom&rsquo;s interface is simple. Tap on one of the six toys to open it, and when you&rsquo;re finished, tap the big circle that&rsquo;s always visible and animated in the upper left corner of the screen. That&rsquo;s all any child needs to figure out to enjoy themselves.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="Pok Pok Playroom makes navigating between toys simple for young kids." src="https://cdn.macstories.net/ivborw0kggoaaaansuheugaaclaaaaeacayaaac7j4iiaaaacxbiwxmaabylaaawjqfjuitwaaalgmluwhrytuw6y29tlmfkb2jl-1621505636527.png" /><p class="image-caption">Pok Pok Playroom makes navigating between toys simple for young kids.</p></div>
<p id="p9">The only other UI element is a small inconspicuous icon in the lower right corner of the title screen, which is for grown-ups. To enter the grown-up area, you have to enter the time into a keypad, which unlocks the area where parents can sign up for play kits, explore learning prompts designed by educators that collaborated with the developers, displays the latest artwork created in the app, which can be shared via the share sheet, and instructions on how to set up guided access, so kids can only access Pok Pok Playroom.</p>
<p id="p10">Each of the six play areas in Pok Pok features brightly colored, interactive elements that come to life with playful animations and sound. Tap the globe icon for a scrollable catalog of people, vehicles, occupations, and objects. It&rsquo;s like a picture book, but everything is animated and responds to touch. There&rsquo;s a town, too, where you can move vehicles through the streets, park them, move people and objects around, and open and close doors, for example. Panning around the map of the town, kids will encounter a wide variety of environments.</p>

<p id="p12">There are musical and drawing tools too. The music toy is a series of shapes that can be dragged around the canvas creating sounds when they collide. It&rsquo;s an interesting mash-up of collision physics, color, shapes, and sound that&rsquo;s a lot of fun to experiment with. The drawing tool offers eight colors for drawing and a slider to wipe the canvas clear for a new picture.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="Kids can create their own characters from an endless collection of blocks." src="https://cdn.macstories.net/ivborw0kggoaaaansuheugaaclaaaaeacayaaac7j4iiaaaacxbiwxmaabylaaawjqfjuitwaaalgmluwhrytuw6y29tlmfkb2jl-1621505703219.png" /><p class="image-caption">Kids can create their own characters from an endless collection of blocks.</p></div>
<p id="p14">Another toy offers an endless, colorful collection of mix-and-match body segments, letting kids build characters from sets of different feet, bodies, heads, and hats. As you swipe left and right, new options drop onto the canvas that can be combined into characters.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="Pok Pok Playroom's gadgets are fun to explore." src="https://cdn.macstories.net/ivborw0kggoaaaansuheugaaclaaaaeacayaaac7j4iiaaaacxbiwxmaabylaaawjqfjuitwaaalgmluwhrytuw6y29tlmfkb2jl-1621505689105.png" /><p class="image-caption">Pok Pok Playroom&rsquo;s gadgets are fun to explore.</p></div>
<p id="p16">The final toy is one of my favorites. When you open it, there&rsquo;s nothing but a red button on the screen. Tap it, and the Pok Pok Playroom&rsquo;s canvas fills with all kinds of gizmos and gadgets. There are sliders, buttons, levers, wheels, and all manner of other controls tied to mechanical and electronic objects. Everything is interactive and responds with delightful animations and sounds.</p>
<p id="p17"><a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/snowman-announces-new-creative-studio-and-its-first-app-pok-pok-playroom-a-digital-play-experience-for-kids/" rel="noopener noreferrer">As I wrote last week</a>, Pok Pok Playroom is from the brand new creative studio called <a href="https://playpokpok.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pok Pok</a> that grew out of <a href="https://www.builtbysnowman.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">Snowman</a>, the studio known for creating a long list of terrific games for Apple&rsquo;s platforms. Pok Pok Playroom captures the same sort of relaxed playfulness of a game like <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/altos-adventure-review-a-beautiful-descent/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alto&rsquo;s Adventure</a> without being a game in the traditional sense. Instead, it&rsquo;s a self-paced digital toy that captures the same sense of fun in digital toys that I&rsquo;m sure a lot of kids will love.</p>
<p id="p18">Pok Pok Playroom <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok-pok-playroom/id1550204730" rel="noopener noreferrer">is available on the App Store</a>. There&rsquo;s a 14-day free trial, after which you can subscribe for $3.99 or $29.99/year. Pok Pok has said that new toys will be added to the app periodically.</p>

    <div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="Source: Apple." src="https://cdn.macstories.net/untitled-1621448286426.jpg" /><p class="image-caption">Source: Apple.</p></div>
<p id="p2">Tomorrow, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/apple-previews-powerful-software-updates-designed-for-people-with-disabilities/?videoid=f1bb24771983cb490866c3570030eeb9" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple will launch SignTime</a>, a service that will pair Apple Store and Apple Support customers with on-demand sign language interpreters. The company has several other accessibility features coming too, which will be released later this year.</p>
<p id="p3">SignTime will allow customers to communicate with AppleCare and Retail Customer Care inside their browsers using American Sign Language, British Sign Language, and French Sign Language. The service will also be available in-person at retail stores without making arrangements ahead of time. For now, the service is limited to the US, UK, and France, but Apple says it will roll out to more countries over time.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"></div>
<p id="p5">Later this year, Apple will add AssistiveTouch to the Apple Watch. The feature uses hand clenches, pinch gestures, and hand shaking to navigate and select controls in Watch apps. Assistive Touch for the Apple Watch takes advantage of the device&rsquo;s gyroscope and accelerometer along with the heart rate sensor and machine learning.</p>
<p id="p6">Also, coming later this year, the iPad will gain support for third-party eye-tracking devices to assist users in navigating the iPad&rsquo;s UI. VoiceOver is also being enhanced with new details about people, text, table data, and other objects. The feature will offer far more descriptive information for blind and low vision users than ever before. Users will also be able to add their own image descriptions to their photos using Markup.</p>
<p id="p7">For deaf and hard of hearing users, Apple is adding bi-directional hearing aid support. The company is also including support for audiograms, which can be used with Headphone Accommodations to tune playback to a user&rsquo;s hearing. Background sounds like balanced, bright, or dark noise, and ocean, rain, and stream sounds are being added too.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="Source: Apple." src="https://cdn.macstories.net/apple_gaad21_new-memoji_05192021-1621448293849.jpg" /><p class="image-caption">Source: Apple.</p></div>
<p id="p9">Also coming later this year are Sound Actions for Switch Control that uses mouth sounds in place of switches and buttons, customizable display and text size settings for colorblind users, and new Memoji customizations to allow users to add oxygen tubes, cochlear implants, and a soft helmet for headwear. Many of Apple&rsquo;s apps and services will also be marking Global Accessibility Awareness Day, which is tomorrow, with features, curated collections of content, and sessions.</p>
<p id="p10">It&rsquo;s fantastic to see such a long list of accessibility features being added to Apple&rsquo;s devices tomorrow and later in the year, which presumably means this fall when the company&rsquo;s OSes are expected to be updated. It&rsquo;s also unusual for upcoming OS features to be revealed before WWDC, but with Global Accessibility Awareness Day coming tomorrow, it&rsquo;s an excellent opportunity to spotlight these important additions to Apple&rsquo;s OSes and perhaps to free up time at WWDC for other announcements.</p>

    <div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="The new iPad Pro." src="https://cdn.macstories.net/img_2287-1621270775533.jpeg" /><p class="image-caption">The new iPad Pro.</p></div>
<p id="p2">In recent years, the narrative surrounding the iPad platform, and particularly its more advanced Pro line, has largely focused on the great divide between the iPad&rsquo;s hardware and software. It&rsquo;s a story we&rsquo;ve had to grapple with for a while now: it was clear with the <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ipad-pro-review/" rel="noopener noreferrer">original iPad Pro in 2015</a> that its software &ndash; still called iOS at the time &ndash; needed to take better advantage of the 12.9&rdquo; display, but we had to wait until 2017&rsquo;s iOS 11 to receive <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-11-the-macstories-review/18/#drag-and-drop" rel="noopener noreferrer">drag and drop between apps</a>; similarly, the iPad Pro was <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/the-new-11-and-12-9-ipad-pros-my-first-impressions-and-hands-on/" rel="noopener noreferrer">redesigned in late 2018</a> with the Liquid Retina Display and a gesture-based interaction system, but it was only in 2019 that Apple <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-13-the-macstories-review/20/#ipados" rel="noopener noreferrer">relaunched the iPad&rsquo;s software</a> as a standalone platform parallel to iOS but optimized for iPad.</p>
<p id="p3">The perception since the iPad Pro&rsquo;s introduction is that its hardware has consistently leapfrogged its software, leaving many to wonder about the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22391979/apple-ipad-pro-vs-macbook-air-2021-anouncement" rel="noopener noreferrer">untapped potential of iPadOS</a> and a third-party app ecosystem that could have been vastly richer and more powerful if only iPadOS allowed developers to write more complex apps. Effectively, &ldquo;too good for its software&rdquo; has long been the iPad Pro&rsquo;s hardware mantra.</p>
<p id="p4">The 2021 iPad Pro, launching publicly this Friday, doesn&rsquo;t alter that public perception at all. If anything, this new iPad Pro, which I&rsquo;ve been testing in the high-end 12.9&rdquo; flavor with 2&nbsp;TB of storage for the past week, only widens the chasm between its hardware and software: it&rsquo;s an absolute marvel of engineering featuring the Apple-designed M1 chip, a brand new Liquid Retina XDR display, and 16&nbsp;GB of RAM<sup id="fnref-66866-RAM"><a class="jetpack-footnote" href="https://www.macstories.net/feed/#fn-66866-RAM" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a></sup> that hints at a powerful, exciting future for its software that just isn&rsquo;t here yet.</p>

</aside><p id="p6">I say this as someone who&rsquo;s been using the iPad as his main computer for <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/beyond-the-tablet/" rel="noopener noreferrer">nearly</a> a decade at this point: from a mere hardware standpoint, the new iPad Pro is everything I could have possibly dreamed of this year, but it leaves me wanting for so many other iPadOS features I&rsquo;d love to see Apple address at its <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-announces-that-wwdc-2021-will-be-online-only-again-from-june-7-11/" rel="noopener noreferrer">developer conference next month</a>.</p>
<p id="p7">The new 12.9&rdquo; iPad Pro hits all the right notes as a <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/modular-computer/" rel="noopener noreferrer">modular computer</a> that can be a tablet with an amazing display, a powerful laptop, and an extensible workstation; its hardware is a remarkable blend of tablet-first features and technologies <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/the-m1-mac-mini-and-macbook-air-a-giant-leap-forward-for-all-mac-users/" rel="noopener noreferrer">first seen</a> on Apple&rsquo;s line of desktop computers. It&rsquo;s hard to believe the company was able to deliver all of it in a device that is only 6.4mm thin. However, the new iPad Pro&rsquo;s more powerful nature doesn&rsquo;t fundamentally change <em>my</em> daily workflow. At least not with its <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-14-the-macstories-review/11/#ipados" rel="noopener noreferrer">current version of iPadOS</a> that will (likely) be obsolete in two weeks.</p>

<p>Created by our designer <a href="https://twitter.com/_silviagatta" rel="noopener noreferrer noopener noreferrer">Silvia Gatta</a> and modeled after the Home Screen wallpapers we originally shared in <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ipad-air-review-forward-looking/" rel="noopener noreferrer noopener noreferrer">my iPad Air review</a>, these wallpapers feature colorful gradients and a special area dedicated to widgets. The new versions for the 2021&nbsp;12.9&rdquo; iPad Pro come with a pure black &lsquo;widget column&rsquo; that takes advantage of the Liquid Retina XDR display and which works well with pure black widgets.</p>
<p>You can find screenshots of my Home Screen with these wallpapers in the story; if you&rsquo;re a Club MacStories member, you can download the wallpapers in your member area at <a href="https://macstories.memberful.com/account/downloads" rel="noopener noreferrer noopener noreferrer">macstories.memberful.com</a>.</p>

<h2 id="look-and-feel">Look and Feel</h2>
<p id="p12">From the outside, the new iPad Pro looks identical to its predecessor: its physical footprint is the same, the shape of the Liquid Retina Display&rsquo;s rounded corners is unchanged, and Apple has kept the 2018 iPad Pro&rsquo;s industrial design with flat edges that has proven successful with the <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/apples-iphone-12-lineup-the-macstories-overview/" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone 12 line</a>, the <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ipad-air-review-forward-looking/" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPad Air</a>, and, to an extent, the latest <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-shows-off-new-m1-imacs-in-beautiful-vibrant-colors/" rel="noopener noreferrer">iMacs</a>. At a glance, you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to tell the 2020 and 2021 iPad Pros apart. It almost feels like there&rsquo;s a continuum to Apple&rsquo;s strategy with shipping its first generation of custom silicon on portable computers: just like the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/the-m1-macbook-air-and-13-macbook-pro-the-macstories-overview/" rel="noopener noreferrer">got the M1 upgrade</a> without any major redesigns, so too the iPad Pro has made the jump to the much more powerful M1 chip without looking any different from last year.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="Old and new." src="https://cdn.macstories.net/img_2265-1621295504098.jpeg" /><p class="image-caption">Old and new.</p></div>
<p id="p14">However, I <em>felt</em> the difference between the old and new 12.9&rdquo; iPad Pro when I held the device in my hands for the first time and compared it to its predecessor. At 685 grams, the Wi-Fi + Cellular version is 42 grams heavier than the 643 grams of the 2020 model; the new iPad Pro is also 0.5mm thicker (likely due to the new display technology), which, as I&rsquo;ll explain later, has led to some unfortunate consequences in the accessory market. These aren&rsquo;t huge numbers, but the weight difference in particular is enough to tell the new iPad Pro is <em>slightly</em> heavier than the previous model, especially if you try to use it as a tablet in one-handed mode. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend doing that with a 12.9&rdquo; iPad anyway, but if you&rsquo;re like me and love to read articles with Safari on the iPad Pro&rsquo;s large display, you shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if you can feel a small weight increase.</p>
<p id="p15">As for the 0.5mm gain in thickness, as you can tell from the photos in this story it is visually noticeable when comparing the 2020 and 2021 iPad Pro side by side, but it&rsquo;s not a big deal in everyday usage. Unless you&rsquo;re one of the few people who spent $400 on the Kensington StudioDock <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/first-impressions-kensingtons-studiodock-aims-to-turn-your-ipad-pro-into-an-expandable-desktop-workstation/" rel="noopener noreferrer">a couple months ago</a>. But more on that later.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="The new iPad Pro (left) is 0.5mm thicker than the previous model." src="https://cdn.macstories.net/fullsizerender-1621351678017.jpeg" /><p class="image-caption">The new iPad Pro (left) is 0.5mm thicker than the previous model.</p></div>
<p id="p17">The 2021 iPad Pro relies on a tried and proven aesthetic that still feels fresh and futuristic three years after its debut. I haven&rsquo;t grown tired of the iPad Pro&rsquo;s industrial design yet, and the device &ndash; despite a 0.5mm increase &ndash; still feels impossibly thin for all it does and its battery life. The 12.9&rdquo; iPad Pro has never been Apple&rsquo;s most portable tablet, but based on my tests over the past week, even though I can feel those extra 42 grams, I still plan on using it as a tablet I can hold in my hands at the end of the work day when I want to relax with games or my Safari Reading List.</p>
<h2 id="liquid-retina-xdr-display">Liquid Retina XDR Display</h2>
<p id="p18">There was a specific moment when the new iPad Pro&rsquo;s Liquid Retina XDR display &ldquo;clicked&rdquo; for me: I was testing both the 2020 and 2021 iPad Pro models side by side by watching the introductory scene of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greatest_Showman" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Greatest Showman</a> in Dolby Vision using the TV app, and I noticed how the XDR display &ndash; which brings the extreme dynamic range technology previously seen in the $4,999 Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/pro-display-xdr/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pro Display XDR</a> to a $1,099&nbsp;12.9&rdquo; tablet &ndash; featured more vivid reds and considerably brighter highlights. That was neat, I thought to myself, but obviously there had to be <em>something</em> else to justify Apple&rsquo;s excitement about the new display in the 12.9&rdquo; iPad Pro. Right?</p>
<p id="p19">And that&rsquo;s when I looked at the darker areas of the frame, particularly the black bars surrounding the video. That&rsquo;s when the Liquid Retina XDR display got me:</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="The new iPad Pro (left) features more accurate colors and near-pure blacks. Colors on the 2020 iPad Pro (right) look washed out in comparison." src="https://cdn.macstories.net/img_2324-1621295127780.jpeg" /><p class="image-caption">The new iPad Pro (left) features more accurate colors and near-pure blacks. Colors on the 2020 iPad Pro (right) look washed out in comparison.</p></div>
<p id="p21">I don&rsquo;t own an Apple Pro Display XDR, so take the following experience and summarization with the context of someone who mostly used to work on a 2020&nbsp;12.9&rdquo; iPad Pro and 21.5&rdquo; UltraFine 4K display.</p>
<p id="p22">The new iPad Pro&rsquo;s Liquid Retina XDR display is, by far, the best display I&rsquo;ve ever seen in a portable computer. It puts the iPad Pro&rsquo;s old (and still pretty good) Liquid Retina Display to shame thanks to its higher brightness (1000 nits of full-screen brightness compared to 600 in the last-gen model), more vibrant colors, highlights that pop out a lot more, and black levels that almost rival the performance of &ldquo;pure black&rdquo; on OLED displays.</p>
<p id="p23">This display was pitched as a great way for creators of HDR content to take their workflows on the go as well as a superior experience for consumers of HDR content such as movies and TV shows from Apple TV+ and Netflix or photos taken with Smart HDR on iPhone. After a week of testing, I think that message makes sense: if you&rsquo;re a videographer or photographer, you&rsquo;ll instantly see and understand the impact of wider color reproduction; if you&rsquo;re a &ldquo;regular&rdquo; iPad user who doesn&rsquo;t work in those fields, you won&rsquo;t see the effects of the XDR display in the UI of Apple Mail or Files, but you&rsquo;ll &ldquo;get it&rdquo;, just like I did, as soon as you watch HDR content, play a game, or browse your photo library.</p>
<aside class="pull-quote aligncenter" id="aside24"><blockquote>
<p>The new iPad Pro&rsquo;s Liquid Retina XDR display is, by far, the best display I&rsquo;ve ever seen in a portable computer.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside><p id="p25">There&rsquo;s some fascinating tech that makes the Liquid Retina XDR display&rsquo;s high-brightness and high-contrast performance possible. The display comes with 10,000 mini-LEDs compared to the previous iPad Pro&rsquo;s 72 LEDs; the new mini-LED technology employed by Apple is 120 times smaller than the previous display&rsquo;s design. Additionally, all those mini-LEDs have been grouped into 2596 local dimming zones; the idea is that each zone can control the brightness of its mini-LEDs and precisely adjust it depending on the content displayed onscreen, which explains why video content shot in high-dynamic range features, well, a wider range of colors and brightness levels across the entire 12.9&rdquo; panel.</p>
<p id="p26">In case the quality of this display hasn&rsquo;t come across from this description yet, consider this additional context:</p>
<ul id="ul27"><li>The Pro Display XDR <a href="https://twitter.com/ismh/status/1384592995089936384" rel="noopener noreferrer">features 576 local dimming zones</a> (compared to the iPad Pro&rsquo;s 2596) for $4,999;</li>
<li>The iPad Pro fully matches the Pro Display XDR&rsquo;s sustained brightness performance (1000 nits) as well as its peak brightness (1600 nits) when watching HDR content;</li>
<li>The iPhone 12 Pro&rsquo;s OLED display can deliver up to 800 nits with full-screen brightness and maxes out at 1200 nits for peak brightness;</li>
<li>The new 24&rdquo; iMac supports P3 wide color and True Tone, but maxes out at 500 nits.</li>
</ul><p id="p28">Thus, a good way to think about the new Liquid Retina XDR display is the following: Apple was able to take some of the high-end technology that powered the Pro Display XDR, shrink it down to a 12.9&rdquo; display, and even improve it thanks to mini-LED, going from 576 dimming zones to 2596 &ndash; a whopping 350% increase for a multitouch tablet you can hold in your hands. Obviously, unlike the Pro Display XDR, the Liquid Retina XDR display isn&rsquo;t considered a reference monitor with support for advanced features such as <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210804" rel="noopener noreferrer">manual calibration</a>; however, for a product starting at $1099, bringing extreme dynamic range to the &ldquo;prosumer&rdquo; market is quite the achievement, and a substantial leap from the older Liquid Retina display.</p>
<p id="p29">At this point, you might wonder: all this sounds impressive, but do you <em>actually</em> notice these fancy display improvements in everyday usage? The answer is nuanced, but after a week with the new iPad Pro, I think there are some common scenarios in which everyone will immediately see the difference between the old Liquid Retina Display and the new Liquid Retina XDR.</p>
<p id="p30">The first, must-try test is iPadOS&rsquo; dark mode or any kind of image/video featuring dark areas: on the Liquid Retina XDR display, black levels approach the &ldquo;true black&rdquo; quality of the iPhone&rsquo;s OLED display; a pure black color displayed on the Liquid Retina XDR is deep and nearly indistinguishable from the iPad Pro&rsquo;s black bezels. I say &ldquo;nearly&rdquo; because, due to the nature of OLED, only the iPhone&rsquo;s display can achieve real &ldquo;true black&rdquo; and turn off pixels displaying the color black. I tested this by comparing the iPad Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max with a pure black JPEG image displayed in full-screen: upon closer inspection, I could barely make out the display from the bezels on the new iPad Pro, but I couldn&rsquo;t on the iPhone&rsquo;s OLED display.</p>
<p id="p31">So while, technically speaking, the Liquid Retina XDR&rsquo;s black color reproduction isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;true black&rdquo;, it gets dramatically close to that goal. I would even say that, because you typically hold an iPad further away from your eyes, ultimately this difference doesn&rsquo;t matter: to my eyes, it <em>feels</em> like the Liquid Retina XDR supports true black, which has an incredible effect on using apps with true-black dark modes on the new iPad Pro. Contrast between black UI elements and white text is higher than before, and there&rsquo;s also better separation between black sidebars and other dark gray or dark blue UI elements such as lists and popovers. I never used dark mode extensively on iPad because I preferred the way it looked on the iPhone&rsquo;s OLED display; I&rsquo;m going to reconsider now thanks to the Liquid Retina XDR&rsquo;s fantastic black levels.</p>
<p id="p32">Comparing black levels between the old iPad Pro and the new one makes the 2020 model look blissfully ignorant of what the color &lsquo;black&rsquo; actually is or what it&rsquo;s supposed to look like. Check out the photo below, which shows the same black image displayed on a 2020 iPad Pro and the 2021 model at max brightness in a dark room with Night Mode <em>disabled</em>&hellip;</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="This is the same full-screen black image displayed on the Liquid Retina XDR (left) and 2020 iPad Pro. Yes, the 2021 iPad Pro&rsquo;s screen is showing that image at full brightness." src="https://cdn.macstories.net/img_2323-1621295256746.jpeg" /><p class="image-caption">This is the same full-screen black image displayed on the Liquid Retina XDR (left) and 2020 iPad Pro. Yes, the 2021 iPad Pro&rsquo;s screen is showing that image at full brightness.</p></div>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="Same as above. This is wild to see in person." src="https://cdn.macstories.net/img_2201-1621368127968.jpeg" /><p class="image-caption">Same as above. This is wild to see in person.</p></div>
<p id="p35">&hellip;and you should get the idea now. On the old iPad Pro, it seems like you&rsquo;re visualizing a dark gray/blueish image, but that&rsquo;s actually how pure black color was reproduced on the old display. On the mini-LED Liquid Retina XDR, you can see where the display ends and the bezels begin, but just barely.</p>
<p id="p36">In real-life, this comparison looks incredible, and if you work with black colors or use apps featuring pure black themes a lot, this improvement alone may be worth upgrading to a new iPad Pro with the Liquid Retina XDR display. Personally, as I mentioned above, I plan on taking advantage of this by switching more of my favorite apps to pure black mode on iPad Pro. I&rsquo;ve also taken this as an opportunity to design wallpapers optimized for the new iPad Pro with a pure-black area for widgets on the left side of the Home Screen, which are exclusive to Club MacStories members.<sup id="fnref-66866-widgetDark"><a class="jetpack-footnote" href="https://www.macstories.net/feed/#fn-66866-widgetDark" rel="noopener noreferrer">2</a></sup> Alternatively, a pure black Home Screen also looks fantastic on the new iPad Pro, as you can see in the photo below.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="One of the new wallpapers for Club members features a pure black widget column for the Liquid Retina XDR display." src="https://cdn.macstories.net/img_2276-1621295326905.jpeg" /><p class="image-caption">One of the new wallpapers for Club members features a pure black widget column for the Liquid Retina XDR display.</p></div>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="A pure black Home Screen also looks fantastic on the Liquid Retina XDR display." src="https://cdn.macstories.net/img_2469-1621351441662.jpeg" /><p class="image-caption">A pure black Home Screen also looks fantastic on the Liquid Retina XDR display.</p></div>
<p id="p39">Besides its excellent black levels, the Liquid Retina XDR outperforms the old Liquid Retina display when it comes to HDR content. In addition to being brighter, there&rsquo;s more range between darker areas of an image and its highlights, which pop off the screen more. In a test photo (taken with Smart HDR 3) I opened on both the old and new iPad Pro, the same neon sign looked brighter on the XDR display and more dimmed on the old Liquid Retina Display. After repeating these tests with more photos and HDR content from Apple TV+, the iTunes Store, and Netflix, I now see colors on the old iPad Pro as washed out and dull; on the XDR display, bright colors are considerably more vibrant, black is real black, and I can appreciate the extreme dynamic range across the full picture, especially for HDR movies.</p>
<p id="p40">Should you upgrade from your 2020 iPad Pro<sup id="fnref-66866-2018Model"><a class="jetpack-footnote" href="https://www.macstories.net/feed/#fn-66866-2018Model" rel="noopener noreferrer">3</a></sup> to the 2021 version because of the XDR display alone? If you primarily use your iPad to communicate with Mail and Messages or crunch numbers in spreadsheets &ndash; if your interactions with iPadOS are mostly limited to staring at white app UIs, essentially &ndash; you&rsquo;re likely not going to appreciate the breadth of the Liquid Retina XDR display. However, if you work with HDR content, consume it on streaming services, enjoy browsing your photo library, or just <em>really</em> enjoy dark mode with pure black themes, I&rsquo;d say yes. The display is magnificent, and it&rsquo;s wild to consider how Apple was able to bring its XDR tech from a 32&rdquo; display to a comparatively diminutive 12.9&rdquo; tablet thanks to mini-LEDs.</p>
<p id="p41">The Liquid Retina XDR display has clear benefits you can see and enjoy in iPadOS 14&nbsp;<em>today</em>. The same is only partially true for this iPad Pro&rsquo;s two new hardware additions &ndash; Thunderbolt and the M1 chip.</p>
<h2 id="thunderbolt">Thunderbolt</h2>
<p id="p42">After moving away from Lightning three years ago with USB-C in the 2018 iPad Pro, 2021 marks another milestone for the iPad&rsquo;s expandability and modularity: the new iPad Pro keeps the same connector but adds support for USB 4 and, perhaps more importantly in the Apple ecosystem, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderbolt_(interface)#Thunderbolt_3" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thunderbolt 3</a>.</p>
<p id="p43">I find Thunderbolt a welcome, yet surprising addition to the iPad Pro. There are two key advantages to using Thunderbolt: four times the bandwidth compared to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_3.0#USB_3.2" rel="noopener noreferrer">USB 3.2 Gen. 2</a> (up to 40&nbsp;Gb/s) and the ability to daisy-chain multiple devices to the host computer, including a 6K display such as Apple&rsquo;s Pro Display XDR. Neither of these features are areas where iPadOS is particularly specialized at the moment: high-bandwidth data transfers are usually beneficial for folks who work with professional audio or video apps such <a href="https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Logic Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Final Cut Pro</a>, which aren&rsquo;t available on iPad Pro; and iPadOS 14&rsquo;s support for external displays <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/modular-computer/#full-screen-apps" rel="noopener noreferrer">continues to be abysmal</a> since the system lacks a proper &ldquo;extended desktop mode&rdquo; that lets you put additional windows on a secondary monitor instead of mirroring whatever is already displayed on the iPad&rsquo;s screen.</p>
<p id="p44">So why is Thunderbolt support here?</p>
<p id="p45">As I&rsquo;m going to demonstrate below, data transfers to external Thunderbolt drives are ridiculously faster than USB 3.2 and, sure, you can mirror the iPad Pro&rsquo;s display to a 6K monitor now.<sup id="fnref-66866-displayMirroring"><a class="jetpack-footnote" href="https://www.macstories.net/feed/#fn-66866-displayMirroring" rel="noopener noreferrer">4</a></sup> Today, there really aren&rsquo;t many reasons why you&rsquo;d need Thunderbolt 3 on an iPad Pro except for ensuring cross-platform compatibility with your existing Thunderbolt setup. Thus, I have to believe Apple added Thunderbolt to <em>prepare</em> for future iPadOS software that will truly take advantage of it.</p>
<p id="p46">That leaves us in an awkward spot right now. On one hand, it&rsquo;s fun to imagine how Apple could tap into Thunderbolt&rsquo;s potential with iPadOS 15 using iPad versions of Logic and Final Cut or perhaps a new &ldquo;extended Home Screen mode&rdquo; for external displays. I would be shocked if these features aren&rsquo;t part of iPadOS 15 at WWDC. On the other hand, I have to take Thunderbolt support on iPad Pro at face value right now, two weeks ahead of WWDC, and explain why, yes, it works with my Belkin dock and 4K display but also feels pretty much wasted in iPadOS 14.</p>
<p id="p47">I was able to test Thunderbolt on the 2021 iPad Pro with my recently-updated desktop setup, which revolves around a <a href="https://www.belkin.com/us/business/hubs-and-docks-for-business/docking-stations-for-business/thunderbolt-3-dock-pro/p/p-f4u097/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Dock Pro</a>. The dock is connected to my LG UltraFine 4K display via Thunderbolt; then, depending on whether I want to use my Mac mini or iPad Pro, I connect another Thunderbolt cable to those computers by swapping it in the back of the dock. I also have two Magic Trackpads (one for each device since the Magic Trackpad doesn&rsquo;t support multi-device pairing) and a <a href="https://satechi.net/products/slim-x1-bluetooth-backlit-keyboard?variant=33573650071640" rel="noopener noreferrer">Satechi Slim X1 keyboard</a> that can switch between the Mac mini and iPad Pro.</p>
<p id="p48">I won&rsquo;t lie: it&rsquo;s nice that I can extend and use the iPad Pro with the same dock usually paired with my Mac mini. I tested the Belkin dock + iPad Pro combo with USB drives plugged into the dock (they showed up correctly in the Files app), SD cards, and headphones connected via the dock&rsquo;s audio port. I even tested high-resolution music playback by plugging my <a href="https://fiio.com/q5s" rel="noopener noreferrer">FiiO Q5S</a> external USB DAC into the dock, connecting my <a href="http://www.sonypremiumhome.com/signature-series/MDR-Z1R.php" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sony MDR-Z1R headphones</a> via a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanced_audio" rel="noopener noreferrer">balanced</a> 4.4mm cable to the DAC, and playing ultra-HD music via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amazon-music-songs-podcasts/id510855668" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Music app</a>. It all worked, and I can&rsquo;t wait to <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-announces-spatial-audio-and-lossless-playback-for-apple-music-subscribers-coming-in-june/" rel="noopener noreferrer">test this with Apple Music next month</a>.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="My Thunderbolt setup featuring a 2021 iPad Pro, Mac mini, Belkin dock, external USB DAC, and Sony headphones.

<p id="p51">This <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/modular-computer/#usb-dac-mode" rel="noopener noreferrer">kind</a> of modularity and the ability to turn the iPad Pro into a flexible desktop workstation aren&rsquo;t new, of course: I <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/modular-computer/#desk-mode" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> about this very topic extensively in the past. What&rsquo;s nice about Thunderbolt is that I can now take my modular approach even further with high-speed docks that provide access to a variety of additional ports with the only requirement that I swap a cable based on the computer I want to use at my desk. As was the case before, the problem is that I wish iPadOS could do more with this versatility: let me manage multiple windows on an external monitor, use the iPad Pro in clamshell mode, &ldquo;pin&rdquo; external drives as bookmarks on the Home Screen, or <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/beyond-the-tablet/11/#podcasting-from-ipad-pro" rel="noopener noreferrer">record podcasts with my USB interface</a> just like I can on the Mac. These are old issues; they&rsquo;re now exacerbated by the fact that Thunderbolt is <em>so</em> fast and nicely integrated with the Apple ecosystem. It&rsquo;s a teaser that leaves me pining for more.</p>
<p id="p52">Right now, I think the only Thunderbolt feature all iPad Pro users can benefit from is the faster data transfer to and from external drives. In my tests, when it came to transferring large files such as 4K video assets, the Thunderbolt hype was justified. For my comparisons, I used a <a href="https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/minisite/ssd/product/portable/x5/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung X5 Thunderbolt drive</a> (2,800&nbsp;MB/s read, 2,300&nbsp;MB/s write) and Samsung&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/minisite/ssd/product/portable/t7-touch/" rel="noopener noreferrer">T7 external SSD</a>, which is a USB-C drive based on the USB 3.2 Gen. 2 spec (10&nbsp;Gb/s transfers compared to Thunderbolt&rsquo;s 40&nbsp;Gb/s) and an advertised transfer rate of 1,050&nbsp;MB/s (read) and 1,000&nbsp;MB/s (write). Here&rsquo;s how it went:</p>
<ul id="ul53"><li>8.2&nbsp;GB file from X5 (Thunderbolt) to iPad local storage: <strong>21 seconds</strong> </li>
<li>8.2&nbsp;GB file from iPad local storage to X5 (Thunderbolt): <strong>15 seconds</strong> </li>
<li>8.2&nbsp;GB file from T7 (USB) to iPad local storage: <strong>21 seconds</strong> </li>
<li>8.2&nbsp;GB file from iPad local storage to T7 (USB): <strong>27 seconds</strong></li>
</ul><p id="p54">These numbers confirm a couple things: first, Thunderbolt is obviously much faster than USB since going from 27 seconds to transfer a video file down to 15 is a 45% decrease, which adds up over time if you do this for a living; second, read speeds don&rsquo;t really matter for this kind of file since it always takes around 20 seconds to move 8.2&nbsp;GB of data from an external drive to the iPad&rsquo;s internal storage. However, something interesting happened when I tried to replicate the same test with a 2020 iPad Pro:</p>
<ul id="ul55"><li>8.2&nbsp;GB file from T7 (USB) to 2020 iPad Pro local storage: <strong>32 seconds</strong></li>
</ul><p id="p56">Based on this, it seems that Apple&rsquo;s claim regarding the 2021 iPad Pro having up to 2x faster storage access than the previous model is correct. If you&rsquo;re a videographer and are pondering the purchase of a 2021 iPad Pro with associated Thunderbolt drive, you should also consider that the new iPad Pro is much faster at importing media than the old model.</p>
<p id="p57">There&rsquo;s an unfortunate blemish in all this: the Files app. I&rsquo;ve been recently <a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1392256433387880449" rel="noopener noreferrer">complaining</a> about the app still lacking key features of a modern file manager such as the ability to see the size of a folder or having a progress bar when pasting files, but tests for this review revealed an even more problematic area of Files: its integration with external drives. Any time I copied the aforementioned 8.2&nbsp;GB file from the X5 Thunderbolt drive, the entire Files app froze for several seconds and became unresponsive. Other times I would try to create a Split View with two Files windows to test drag and drop for heavy files, and one window would be entirely blank. At one point, I thought copying and pasting a file had previously failed, so I tried dropping it in the destination folder again, but Files told me the file already existed. Too bad I couldn&rsquo;t see it:</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="Stop lying to me, Files app." src="https://cdn.macstories.net/ivborw0kggoaaaansuheugaac50aaajwcayaaaakgq9xaaaacxbiwxmaaastaaaleweampwyaaam-1621289324305.png" /><p class="image-caption">Stop lying to me, Files app.</p></div>
<p id="p59">All this to say: Thunderbolt is fast and could mean even more modularity for the iPad platform going forward. Right now, a narrow niche of pro users who work in LumaFusion or the handful of other pro video apps for iPad can already take advantage of Thunderbolt on iPad Pro to import and move media more quickly. However, for Thunderbolt to become <em>truly</em> useful for all kinds of iPad Pro users, iPadOS needs to be ready for it. That means doing more with external displays than mirroring, rethinking the Files app around more features and reliability, and extending the iPad&rsquo;s support for external accessories with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/driverkit" rel="noopener noreferrer">DriverKit</a>, allowing iPad Pro owners to work with any peripheral connected via a Thunderbolt dock or USB hub. I seriously hope this is the missing half of the Thunderbolt story we&rsquo;re going to hear at WWDC in a couple weeks.</p>
<h2 id="m1-and-performance">M1 and Performance</h2>
<p id="p60">It&rsquo;s a similar discussion for the iPad Pro&rsquo;s other new marquee addition: the M1 chip, the same previously found in Apple&rsquo;s new generation of Macs that moved away from Intel&rsquo;s chip architecture last year. Few would have probably foreseen the arrival of the M1 chip on iPad (after all, wasn&rsquo;t the &ldquo;M&rdquo; in M1 supposed to stand for &ldquo;Mac&rdquo;?), but I guess it makes sense in grand scheme of whatever Apple has in store for the future of iPad Pro. High-end, desktop-class performance means M1; if the iPad Pro is supposed to achieve Mac-like performance with plenty of headroom for what&rsquo;s next, then the iPad Pro gets the M1 too. That is &ndash; &ldquo;<em>if</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<p id="p61">It shouldn&rsquo;t come as a surprise to anyone that the M1 chip found in the iPad Pro is ridiculously efficient and, to an extent, <em>too powerful</em> for what iPadOS can currently do. With its 8-core CPU, 8-core GPU, and 16-core Neural Engine, the 2021 iPad Pro obliterates previous-gen iPad Pro models with the A12 line of processors; it also runs circles around the iPad Air&rsquo;s A14 SoC, and it compares favorably to the M1 found in recent Macs. I always write in my iPad reviews that numbers never tell the full story; I stand by that &ndash; ultimately, it&rsquo;s what a chip&rsquo;s power allows you to <em>do</em> that matters &ndash; but the new iPad Pro&rsquo;s numbers, with one odd exception, are just astonishing.</p>

</aside><p id="p64">Based on the <a href="https://www.geekbench.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Geekbench</a> results above, you can see how the M1 iPad Pro roughly matches both the M1 MacBook Air and MacBook Pro in single-core performance and is just slightly behind the MacBook Pro in multi-core tests; interestingly, the benchmark <a href="https://twitter.com/imyke" rel="noopener noreferrer">Myke</a> ran on his MacBook Pro with M1 chip provided a lower score in multi-core performance than <a href="https://twitter.com/johnvoorhees" rel="noopener noreferrer">John</a>&rsquo;s MacBook Air. CPU benchmarks can be easily altered by different variables such as background processes and open apps; you should only use these numbers as a general reference. The important factor here is that the M1 chip found in the iPad Pro is indeed a real M1 comparable to the one found in recent Macs. In multi-core performance, the M1 iPad Pro&rsquo;s score is also nearly double the one from the A12Z and the A14 found in the 2020 iPad Pro and iPad Air, respectively.</p>
<aside class="pull-quote aligncenter" id="aside65"><blockquote>
<p>To an extent, the M1 is too powerful for what iPadOS can currently do.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside><p id="p66">I didn&rsquo;t stop at the usual Geekbench tests though. I ran the popular <a href="https://benchmarks.ul.com/3dmark" rel="noopener noreferrer">3DMark Wild Life</a>, a cross-platform benchmark that tests the graphics performance of desktop computers and mobile devices; on Apple platforms, the benchmark uses the Metal API for rendering 3D scenes. Unsurprisingly, the result on the M1 iPad Pro was substantially higher than the A12Z:</p>
<ul id="ul67"><li>M1 iPad Pro Wild Life benchmark: <strong>18,232</strong> score with 109.2 average fps (frame rate range 76 to 149)</li>
<li>A12Z iPad Pro Wild Life benchmark: <strong>13,383</strong> score with 80.1 average fps (frame rate range 53 to 111)</li>
</ul><p id="p68">I then ran the <a href="https://web.basemark.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Basemark Web 3.0</a> benchmark. The M1 beat the A12Z once again:</p>
<ul id="ul69"><li>M1 iPad Pro Basemark: <strong>726</strong> score</li>
<li>A12Z iPad Pro Basemark: <strong>714</strong> score</li>
</ul><p id="p70">What about a cold boot? I measured the time it took both iPad Pros to go from the Apple logo shown onscreen to the Lock Screen after pressing the power button; thanks to its more powerful CPU and faster storage access, the 2021 iPad Pro was also slightly faster than its predecessor for this task:</p>
<ul id="ul71"><li>M1 iPad Pro, Apple logo to Lock Screen: <strong>14 seconds</strong> </li>
<li>A12Z iPad Pro, Apple logo to Lock Screen: <strong>18 seconds</strong></li>
</ul><p id="p72">I then turned to third-party apps that are commonly used by professional users on iPad Pro. One of the features of the M1 chip often touted by Apple is the powerful 16-core Neural Engine, which is used to aid in tasks based on machine learning and deep-learning networks. I put the Neural Engine in the 2021 iPad Pro to the test with <a href="https://www.pixelmator.com/blog/2019/12/17/all-about-the-new-ml-super-resolution-feature-in-pixelmator-pro/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pixelmator Photo&rsquo;s ML Super Resolution</a>, which relies on machine learning (powered by Apple&rsquo;s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml" rel="noopener noreferrer">Core ML</a> framework) to intelligently increase the resolution of photos. For my tests, I used a 24&nbsp;MB RAW file, on which I ran a single pass of ML Super Resolution. The results are, quite frankly, ridiculously good for the M1 chip, confirming once again how much Apple is investing into advancing machine learning performance on its platforms:</p>
<ul id="ul73"><li>M1 iPad Pro, ML Super Resolution compute time: <strong>35 seconds</strong></li>
<li>A12Z iPad Pro, ML Super Resolution compute time: <strong>1 minute and 16 seconds</strong></li>
</ul><div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="Running ML Super Resolution in Pixelmator Photo." src="https://cdn.macstories.net/ivborw0kggoaaaansuheugaac50aaajwcayaaaakgq9xaaaacxbiwxmaaastaaaleweampwyaaam-1621289199297.png" /><p class="image-caption">Running ML Super Resolution in Pixelmator Photo.</p></div>
<p id="p75">After <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pixelmator-photo/id1444636541" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pixelmator Photo</a>, I tried to export a 870&nbsp;MB WAV file from <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ferrite-recording-studio/id1018780185" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ferrite Recording Studio</a> (a popular app used by podcast creators to <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/02/video-editing-podcasts-with-ferrite-and-apple-pencil/" rel="noopener noreferrer">edit and render their shows on iPad Pro</a>) to MP3. Predictably, the M1 iPad Pro came out ahead, taking roughly half the time to export a WAV file to MP3:</p>
<ul id="ul76"><li>M1 iPad Pro, Ferrite export to MP3: <strong>29 seconds</strong></li>
<li>A12Z iPad Pro, Ferrite export to MP3: <strong>56 seconds</strong></li>
</ul><p id="p77">The M1 even makes advanced shortcuts faster, often cutting the time needed to perform CPU-intensive tasks such as image manipulation inside the Shortcuts app <em>in half</em>. For this test, I used my popular <a href="https://www.macstories.net/ios/apple-frames-now-with-support-for-the-2020-ipad-air/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple Frames shortcut</a>, which puts screenshots taken on an iPhone or iPad inside pretty device frames created by Apple. The M1 took 50% less time to frame four iPad screenshots in the Shortcuts app compared to the A12Z:</p>
<ul id="ul78"><li>M1 iPad Pro, compositing four screenshots with Apple Frames: <strong>13 seconds</strong></li>
<li>A12Z iPad Pro, compositing four screenshots with Apple Frames: <strong>26 seconds</strong></li>
</ul><p id="p79">And this is where we get to the strange part of this section. One of the common tests typically involved with benchmarking a new Apple device is rendering video and measuring the time it takes to export a video file to another format. I&rsquo;ve done this for my iPad reviews before, and I assumed repeating the same test on the M1 iPad Pro would show a sizable performance increase compared to the A12Z chip in the 2020 iPad Pro.</p>
<p id="p80">Here&rsquo;s what happened: I tried exporting different source video files using both LumaFusion and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/imovie/id377298193" rel="noopener noreferrer">iMovie</a> on the 2021 iPad Pro and the 2020 model, and I kept getting the same rendering times on both machines &ndash; sometimes down to the second. I thought that was odd, so I continued testing with different input and output formats, and I also added <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adobe-premiere-rush-for-video/id1188753863" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adobe Premiere Rush</a> to my testing setup, but I couldn&rsquo;t see any performance gain with video rendering on the M1 chip; the A12Z consistently matched the M1&rsquo;s rendering times. In a last ditch attempt to try and make sense of all this, I wondered if maybe the issue was related to LumaFusion and iMovie not being &ldquo;optimized&rdquo; for the new iPad Pro, so I put together a custom shortcut to encode a video file to 4K HEVC. When even the shortcut produced the same exact rendering time on both iPads (2 minutes and 48 seconds to export a 706&nbsp;MB 4K video file encoded in H264), I gave up.</p>
<p id="p81">Now, I&rsquo;m not a video expert, and I don&rsquo;t render videos for a living. It&rsquo;s very likely I&rsquo;m missing something obvious here. However, I&rsquo;ve done these tests before and, usually, the new and more powerful chip gets the job done more quickly. It almost feels as if this particular task &ndash; video rendering &ndash; is capped to A12Z-level performance on the M1 iPad Pro with 16&nbsp;GB of RAM I tested for this review. None of this makes sense since, as I&rsquo;ve shown above, <strong>the M1 destroyed the A12Z in literally every other test</strong> or benchmark. I&rsquo;m curious to see if other reviewers who are more well versed in this field will notice similar results.</p>
<hr id="hr82" /><p id="p83">With the exception of the aforementioned video rendering oddity, the M1 chip produced benchmarks and results that were, unsurprisingly, vastly superior to the A12Z. Apple&rsquo;s investment in its custom silicon architecture is paying off, particularly when you consider how the company was able to use the same M1 chip found on Macs in a thinner tablet that also features multitouch and a mini-LED display.</p>
<p id="p84">However, I&rsquo;m left wondering: why was this kind of aggressive performance leap needed? Why do the high-end 1&nbsp;TB and 2&nbsp;TB iPad Pros have 16&nbsp;GB of RAM? Without real background processes, the ability to manage multiple windows on an external display, or pro apps such as Xcode and Final Cut, what are the iPadOS system features or apps that are going to tap into all this power, aside from the narrow use cases I covered above? It&rsquo;s also fair to ask the question: with the common foundation of the M1 chip, shouldn&rsquo;t iPadOS use all this performance headroom to be as flexible as macOS at this point?<sup id="fnref-66866-macOS"><a class="jetpack-footnote" href="https://www.macstories.net/feed/#fn-66866-macOS" rel="noopener noreferrer">5</a></sup></p>
<p id="p85">Given the current limitations of iPadOS such as no extended desktop mode with windowing or widgets on the Home Screen, it&rsquo;s not clear right now why the M1&rsquo;s performance boost was needed. Again, it&rsquo;s easy to imagine how Apple could tap into this future-proofed environment with features that aren&rsquo;t here yet, but I can&rsquo;t review a product based on the <em>potential</em> of what <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/25/21193076/ipad-pro-lidar-software-upates-promises-augmented-reality" rel="noopener noreferrer">software updates could enable in the future</a>. I can speculate, and I think I&rsquo;m going to be right, but ultimately that&rsquo;s just a fun exercise in imagination.</p>
<p id="p86">For my line of work, the 2020 iPad Pro was always powerful enough. Over the past few years, I never found myself wishing my iPad Pro had better specs, but I always craved a more versatile iPadOS optimized for power users. The M1 chip and more RAM make an already future-proof iPad Pro even better prepared for what&rsquo;s coming next. We just have to believe all this new hardware will be put to good use soon.</p>
<h2 id="center-stage">Center Stage</h2>
<p id="p87">The new iPad Pro&rsquo;s most fun (and timely, given our current pandemic-ridden world and importance of video calls) addition is a textbook example of what Apple can achieve when its hardware and software teams collaborate to turn complex ideas into simple, intuitive features that make our lives even just a bit better.</p>
<p id="p88">Center Stage is a new feature of the ultra-wide front-facing camera of the 2021 iPad Pro that iPadOS uses to &ldquo;follow you around&rdquo; as you move during video calls. Made possible by the new 122-degree ultra-wide selfie camera, Center Stage relies on machine learning to recognize you and keep you in the center of the frame as much as possible, zooming and panning around to crop the image accordingly. The way Center Stage works behind the scenes is ingenious: the camera&rsquo;s ultra-wide field of view is cropped to focus on you; if you move around, the system &ldquo;pans&rdquo; to another area of the camera&rsquo;s field of view that wasn&rsquo;t previously displayed onscreen to ensure you stay front and center.</p>
<p id="p89">When you first try Center Stage during a video call<sup id="fnref-66866-videoCall"><a class="jetpack-footnote" href="https://www.macstories.net/feed/#fn-66866-videoCall" rel="noopener noreferrer">6</a></sup>, the effect is both eerie and charming: at first, it&rsquo;ll look like the camera inside the iPad is physically moving, or like there&rsquo;s a remote camera operator secretly controlling the ultra-wide camera to keep you properly framed. Instead, Center Stage is the result of the clever combination of an ultra-wide field of view and real-time cropping powered by machine learning. It is, quite possibly, the best answer to the &ldquo;cool, but what can machine learning <em>actually do</em>?&rdquo; question I&rsquo;ve seen to date.</p>

<p>A FaceTime call with Center Stage.</p>
</div></div>
<p id="p91">I tested Center Stage with FaceTime video calls, WebEx, and a custom app the <a href="http://owenvoorhees.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">MacStories Special Projects Team</a> wrote just for me (more on this below). As you can see in this section, I&rsquo;m supplementing my written explanation with videos and GIFs, which do a better job at conveying Center Stage&rsquo;s capabilities, but here&rsquo;s what you should know: Center Stage is not a gimmick and actually works like magic during video calls. As you move around &ndash; not just left and right, but also further away from the iPad &ndash; Center Stage will seamlessly and quickly pan, zoom out, and zoom back in to keep your face as centered as possible. Motion is smooth but rapid when necessary, and you quickly stop thinking about it and just accept that Center Stage is doing its thing while you&rsquo;re, say, preparing a meal in the kitchen while FaceTiming your parents.</p>
<p id="p92">Impressively, Center Stage also works when another person enters the camera&rsquo;s field of view. When someone else joins you on a video call, the Center Stage-powered camera will pan around and zoom out to include the other person; if they get close to you, Center Stage will zoom in on both faces to keep them front and center. The first time I tried this during FaceTime with my mom, after she saw my girlfriend Silvia enter the shot and the camera continuing to move to follow her too, she proceeded to ask who was operating the camera &ndash; she thought Silvia was moving the iPad to follow me at first. That&rsquo;s Center Stage in a nutshell.</p>
<p id="p93">Center Stage may seem like a trivial addition to video calls on iPad but, as I noted above, it&rsquo;s fascinating to understand how the camera and machine learning work under the hood. For this reason, in order to better understand the capabilities of Center Stage, we created a custom test app that implemented the newly-added <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedevice/3738418-centerstagecontrolmode" rel="noopener noreferrer">Center Stage API for developers</a>. Having the freedom to test Center Stage with a full-screen camera view instead of FaceTime&rsquo;s small preview window helped me get a better sense of how Center Stage works in tandem with the ultra-wide camera and multiple people in the shot; I came away impressed, and I recorded some videos that show Center Stage in action.</p>
<p id="p94">In the first demo below, you can see how Center Stage followed me as I was walking around my balcony while the test app was active:</p>
<div class="media-wrapper video-autoplay js-video-autoplay aligncenter aligncenter" id="div95">
            <video controls="controls" height="1080" preload="auto" width="1440"><source src="https://cdn.macstories.net/center_stage_solo.mp4" type="video/mp4" /><source src="https://cdn.macstories.net/center_stage_solo.webm" type="video/webm" /><source src="https://cdn.macstories.net/center_stage_solo.ogv" type="video/ogg" /></video><div class="caption">
<p>Walking around in front of our custom Center Stage test app.</p>
</div></div>
<p id="p96">I then asked Silvia to join in. You can see how Center Stage tries to zoom out to keep us both in the frame as much as possible when we&rsquo;re not standing close to each other and, conversely, focus on our faces if we get close:</p>
<div class="media-wrapper video-autoplay js-video-autoplay aligncenter aligncenter aligncenter" id="div97">
            <video controls="controls" height="1080" preload="auto" width="1440"><source src="https://cdn.macstories.net/center_stage_two_people.mp4" type="video/mp4" /><source src="https://cdn.macstories.net/center_stage_two_people.webm" type="video/webm" /><source src="https://cdn.macstories.net/center_stage_two_people.ogv" type="video/ogg" /></video><div class="caption">
<p>How Center Stage deals with two people in the shot.</p>
</div></div>
<p id="p98">My favorite example, however, is the last one, which is also tricky to explain. The video begins with an empty shot of my wall. Nobody has entered Center Stage&rsquo;s &ldquo;capture zone&rdquo; yet and the camera is doing nothing. But here&rsquo;s where another key Center Stage feature comes in: Center Stage can &ldquo;see&rdquo; subjects before they&rsquo;re displayed onscreen and immediately zoom and pan the image to focus on them. Which means this is something Center Stage can do:</p>
<div class="media-wrapper video-autoplay js-video-autoplay aligncenter aligncenter aligncenter aligncenter" id="div99">
            <video controls="controls" height="1080" preload="auto" width="1440"><source src="https://cdn.macstories.net/center_stage_creeper_solo.mp4" type="video/mp4" /><source src="https://cdn.macstories.net/center_stage_creeper_solo.webm" type="video/webm" /><source src="https://cdn.macstories.net/center_stage_creeper_solo.ogv" type="video/ogg" /></video><div class="caption">
<p>Creeping in from outside the Center Stage frame.</p>
</div></div>
<p id="p100">And yes, there&rsquo;s a GIF version of this:</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="Oh hi." src="https://cdn.macstories.net/creeper-1621264056952.gif" /><p class="image-caption">Oh hi.</p></div>
<p id="p102">The fun nature of the video above belies an intriguing aspect of the Center Stage framework. I was not displayed onscreen and the camera was seeing an empty wall. However, behind the scenes, the ultra-wide camera was always seeing a wider shot than what was cropped to be displayed onscreen. So as soon as I took a step and entered the invisible Center Stage capture zone, the camera saw me and panned accordingly. You can see how this works from another angle:</p>
<div class="media-wrapper video-autoplay js-video-autoplay aligncenter aligncenter aligncenter aligncenter aligncenter" id="div103">
            <video controls="controls" height="1080" preload="auto" width="1920"><source src="https://cdn.macstories.net/center_stage_creeper_cam_backstage.mp4" type="video/mp4" /><source src="https://cdn.macstories.net/center_stage_creeper_cam_backstage.webm" type="video/webm" /><source src="https://cdn.macstories.net/center_stage_creeper_cam_backstage.ogv" type="video/ogg" /></video><div class="caption">
<p>As soon as I took another step, I walked into the Center Stage capture zone.</p>
</div></div>
<p id="p104">And in case you&rsquo;re wondering, here&rsquo;s what happens if I toggle Center Stage on and off in our test app:</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="When Center Stage is enabled, you can see how the image gets cropped to put my face front and center." src="https://cdn.macstories.net/ivborw0kggoaaaansuheugaac50aaajwcayaaaakgq9xaaaacxbiwxmaaastaaaleweampwyaaam-1621288794067.png" /><p class="image-caption">When Center Stage is enabled, you can see how the image gets cropped to put my face front and center.</p></div>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="With Center Stage disabled, you can see how iPadOS sees the wider shot." src="https://cdn.macstories.net/ivborw0kggoaaaansuheugaac50aaajwcayaaaakgq9xaaaacxbiwxmaaastaaaleweampwyaaam-1621288993890.png" /><p class="image-caption">With Center Stage disabled, you can see how iPadOS sees the wider shot.</p></div>
<p id="p107">I thought about why I find this aspect of Center Stage so fascinating. Here&rsquo;s what I came up with: traditionally, cameras show us exactly what they see &ndash; their viewfinder is a close match of what our eyes can see in front us. There&rsquo;s no hidden truth. The lines have gotten blurry in recent years thanks to AI and features like Night Mode and Smart HDR, but Center Stage takes this to a different level: now, the computer is acting on data the camera is seeing but which is intentionally hidden from us since the image onscreen is cropped to a different aspect ratio. The iPad&rsquo;s camera is aware of its surroundings beyond what is displayed onscreen.<sup id="fnref-66866-captureOutside"><a class="jetpack-footnote" href="https://www.macstories.net/feed/#fn-66866-captureOutside" rel="noopener noreferrer">7</a></sup></p>
<p id="p108">In a way, Center Stage breaks the fourth wall between the user and the computer with a visual, clear confirmation of how the machine knows more than it shows. Am I overthinking this? It&rsquo;s possible. But I also have a feeling we&rsquo;re going to see more of this from now on, especially if Apple is gearing up to release AR-focused devices with multiple cameras that can capture and analyze data around us at all times.</p>
<hr id="hr109" /><p id="p110">There&rsquo;s a few other technical details about Center Stage worth pointing out. Apple has (rightfully so) advertised Center Stage as a video call feature, but any camera-enabled app can use the Center Stage API. We created a custom selfie app for MacStories with Center Stage support in just a couple hours; I assume we&rsquo;re going to see some interesting experiments from developers of photography and video apps for iPad over the next few weeks (imagine, for instance, how journalists and reporters could take advantage of Center Stage when interviewing people or moving around a particular scene).</p>
<p id="p111">Additionally, it appears Apple is also giving any camera-enabled app on iPad the ability to use Center Stage out of the box. In the Settings app on my iPad Pro, I see a new Center Stage toggle in the individual setting pages for apps like Twitter, Discord, and Gmail, which, in theory, haven&rsquo;t added support for Center Stage-specific APIs yet. The toggle for those third-party apps is disabled by default; you can also find the same toggle for FaceTime under Settings &#8702; FaceTime.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="The Center Stage toggle for third-party apps." src="https://cdn.macstories.net/ivborw0kggoaaaansuheugaac50aaajwcayaaaakgq9xaaaacxbiwxmaaastaaaleweampwyaaam-1621288624989.png" /><p class="image-caption">The Center Stage toggle for third-party apps.</p></div>
<p id="p113">Lastly, it also seems like any app that integrates with Center Stage will display a Center Stage splash screen the first time you open it on a 2021 iPad Pro. We didn&rsquo;t do anything to show this screen in our test app, but this is what I saw when I launched the &lsquo;CenterStageTest&rsquo; app for the first time:</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="The Center Stage splash screen I saw in our custom test app." src="https://cdn.macstories.net/ivborw0kggoaaaansuheugaac50aaajwcayaaaakgq9xaaaacxbiwxmaaastaaaleweampwyaaam-1621288674469.png" /><p class="image-caption">The Center Stage splash screen I saw in our custom test app.</p></div>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything Else</h2>
<p id="p115">Here&rsquo;s a collection of miscellaneous notes and tidbits about the new iPad Pro based on my experience with the device.</p>
<p id="p116"><strong>Using the old Magic Keyboard is totally fine.</strong> There was a lot of confusion following the iPad Pro&rsquo;s announcement last month as to whether the 2020 Magic Keyboard was going to be supported on the new iPad Pro model. It initially seemed like the expensive accessory was not going to be compatible with the new iPad Pro, then Apple <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/29/12-9-inch-ipad-pro-magic-keyboard-fit/" rel="noopener noreferrer">explained</a> how the keyboard was going to work, but &ldquo;may not fit precisely when closed&rdquo;.</p>
<p id="p117">I&rsquo;ve used the new iPad Pro with a 2020 Magic Keyboard, and it works perfectly without any issues when closing it. In my tests (<em>without</em> any screen protector), I didn&rsquo;t have any problems attaching the iPad to the old Magic Keyboard, detaching it, or closing the cover on top of it; the magnets align perfectly and there&rsquo;s no gap when the keyboard is closed.</p>
<p id="p118">I feel like Apple sort of fumbled the message here; I honestly can&rsquo;t tell where the problem is supposed to be when using a 2020 Magic Keyboard with the 2021 iPad Pro. The 12.9&rdquo; version works fine and closes fine. If you have a 2020 Magic Keyboard, you don&rsquo;t need to buy a new one.</p>
<p id="p119"><strong>The white Magic Keyboard.</strong> My review unit came with an associated white Magic Keyboard, which is the new color available this year. Let me cut to the chase: I love it. The white cover and keyboard bring a distinct &lsquo;white MacBook&rsquo; feel to the iPad Pro; this retro Apple aesthetic pairs well with a futuristic-looking machine like the iPad Pro &ndash; sort of like a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/DualShock-Wireless-Controller-PlayStation-Anniversary-4/dp/B00ZSDTIGG" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation 1-themed DualShock controller</a> does with a PS4.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="The new white Magic Keyboard." src="https://cdn.macstories.net/fullsizerender-1621295632689.jpeg" /><p class="image-caption">The new white Magic Keyboard.</p></div>

<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/img_2291-1621295691054.jpeg" /><p class="image-caption"></p></div>
<p id="p123">I find the white Magic Keyboard more elegant and Apple-like than last year&rsquo;s boring gray cover with black keys. The &ldquo;Jony Ive look&rdquo; of this version is lovely, but we&rsquo;ll have to see how it ages over time. One week wasn&rsquo;t enough to judge that aspect and, obviously, I&rsquo;ve been treating this review unit well. It didn&rsquo;t seem appropriate to throw the Magic Keyboard in a pile of dirt and claim that &ldquo;I did it for science&rdquo;.</p>
<p id="p124"><strong>The Kensington StudioDock doesn&rsquo;t fit.</strong> Look, I tried to warn you months ago. When I <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/first-impressions-kensingtons-studiodock-aims-to-turn-your-ipad-pro-into-an-expandable-desktop-workstation/" rel="noopener noreferrer">reviewed</a> Kensington&rsquo;s expensive, but versatile desktop accessory for iPad power users, I wrote:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote125"><p>
  [&hellip;] if you plan on purchasing a new iPad Pro in the near future, wait a while to confirm whether or not it&rsquo;ll be compatible with the StudioDock.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p126">As it turns out, a 0.5mm difference in thickness was enough to cause the new iPad Pro not to fit Kensington&rsquo;s plastic tray and USB-C connector anymore. There&rsquo;s a discussion to be had about whether Kensington should have released such an expensive accessory so close to the widely rumored release of new iPad Pros with a new display technology that was likely going to make the device thicker, or if the company should have designed the stand with a replaceable attachment in the first place, but I&rsquo;m going to leave all that for a <a href="https://www.relay.fm/connected/345" rel="noopener noreferrer">podcast</a>.</p>
<p id="p127"><strong>Electric Orange Smart Folio.</strong> In addition to a white Magic Keyboard, Apple sent me an Electric Orange Smart Folio for this review. It&rsquo;s orange. I like it. I wish I could say more about this, but it&rsquo;s just orange. If you like orange, this Smart Folio is orange.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="Hey, at least I wasn&rsquo;t sent a purple iPhone and had to write an entire review about a color." src="https://cdn.macstories.net/img_2298-1621295714085.jpeg" /><p class="image-caption">Hey, at least I wasn&rsquo;t sent a purple iPhone and had to write an entire review about a color.</p></div>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/img_2302-1621295761406.jpeg" /><p class="image-caption"></p></div>
<p id="p130"><strong>Runs iPadOS 14.5 out of the box.</strong> iPadOS 14.5 comes preinstalled with this iPad Pro and has Center Stage, which is exclusive to this device. Interestingly, I had initially upgraded my review unit to iPadOS 14.6 beta 3 so I could restore my iPad Pro backup, but Center Stage wasn&rsquo;t working in that beta release, so I downgraded to iPadOS 14.5.1 by downloading the firmware from Apple&rsquo;s servers, and everything was fine again.</p>
<p id="p131"><strong>The iPhone 12 Pro Max still takes better pictures.</strong> This won&rsquo;t surprise anyone, but despite having support for Smart HDR 3, pictures taken with the wide camera on the 2021 iPad Pro don&rsquo;t look nearly as beautiful as the ones captured on an iPhone 12 Pro Max. This is not shocking at all: the iPhone 12&rsquo;s camera has a &fnof;/1.6 aperture while the iPad Pro is set at &fnof;/1.8; the iPhone&rsquo;s camera simply lets more light in and retains more detail with brighter highlights and true-to-life colors. Still, I feel like Smart HDR 3 photos captured on the 2021 iPad Pro are pretty good for a tablet. You can see two sample shots below.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="Wide camera, iPad Pro." src="https://cdn.macstories.net/img_0069-1621267061965.jpeg" /><p class="image-caption">Wide camera, iPad Pro.</p></div>

<p id="p134"><strong>The Logitech Combo Touch keyboard case.</strong> As I was putting the finishing touches on this review yesterday, I also received a review unit of the <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/ipad-keyboards/combo-touch-ipad.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Combo Touch keyboard case from Logitech</a>. I only needed a few minutes with it to conclude that, while I&rsquo;m convinced there&rsquo;s a market for this kind of accessory, I&rsquo;ve been spoiled by the Magic Keyboard and I can&rsquo;t go back now.</p>
<p id="p135">The Combo Touch is the latest entry in Logitech&rsquo;s long line of keyboard cases for iPad Pro, which go all the way back to the original model <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ipad-pro-accessories-review/#logitech-create" rel="noopener noreferrer">I reviewed in 2015</a>. The Combo Touch stands out for a couple reasons: it&rsquo;s covered with a fabric-like material, which makes it seem more similar to a Microsoft Surface accessory than an iPad Pro one; and, more importantly, it&rsquo;s the first keyboard I&rsquo;ve tested that comes with a built-in trackpad based on the Smart Connector rather than Bluetooth.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="The Logitech Combo Touch for iPad Pro." src="https://cdn.macstories.net/img_2472-1621424595358.jpeg" /><p class="image-caption">The Logitech Combo Touch for iPad Pro.</p></div>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="The Combo Touch with the keyboard detached." src="https://cdn.macstories.net/img_2473-1621424629450.jpeg" /><p class="image-caption">The Combo Touch with the keyboard detached.</p></div>
<p id="p138">As usual, Logitech worked with Apple to make the Combo Touch possible, and it shows: the trackpad &ndash; which is slightly taller than the Magic Keyboard&rsquo;s &ndash; feels great, is clicky enough, and works perfectly with the iPadOS pointer without delays; the keyboard has that classic Logitech feel to it (and I mean this in a positive way!) and comes with function keys for brightness and search, among others, which the Magic Keyboard lacks. If you consider the trackpad and keyboard without the case and everything else, the Combo Touch feels like typing on a &ldquo;pro&rdquo; version of the Magic Keyboard.</p>
<p id="p139">As I hinted above though, the problem is that I&rsquo;m too used to the Magic Keyboard&rsquo;s floating design and portability now. The Combo Touch, as per Logitech tradition, requires you to jam the iPad into a plastic case, which is not something I like to do with a delicate slab of glass. Furthermore, the Combo Touch requires opening a kickstand built into the back of the case to support the iPad Pro and case when they&rsquo;re attached magnetically to the keyboard. As a result, the Combo Touch has a considerably larger footprint than the Magic Keyboard, which makes it nearly impossible for me to use it on my lap.</p>
<p id="p140">The Magic Keyboard, as <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/magic-keyboard-for-ipad-pro-a-new-breed-of-laptop/" rel="noopener noreferrer">I wrote last year</a>, fits squarely within the iPad Pro&rsquo;s modular nature: it can transform the iPad into a laptop, but as soon as you want to go back to tablet mode, you can just detach your iPad from the magnetic cover and switch modes instantly. Accessories like the Combo Touch can&rsquo;t support this kind of flexible modularity. So while I&rsquo;m sure there are folks who will appreciate its adjustable kickstand and removable keyboard, I still find the Magic Keyboard the best fit for my iPad Pro lifestyle.</p>
<p id="p141"><strong>5G.</strong> The new iPad Pro, just like the iPhone 12, supports 5G. I don&rsquo;t particularly care for 5G: I only recently re-enabled it on my iPhone 12 Pro Max because we&rsquo;ve starting going out again and seeing friends in the last couple weeks, but I never found myself having to rely on 5G&rsquo;s ultra-high speed network for anything. When I&rsquo;m out with friends, I don&rsquo;t want to watch YouTube videos in 4K. Still, I figured I should test 5G on the new iPad Pro. My existing iPad cellular plan doesn&rsquo;t support 5G, so I put in my iPhone&rsquo;s SIM card (a Vodafone Italy one) and, sure enough, I got some very good download speeds. I don&rsquo;t know when &ndash; if ever &ndash; I&rsquo;m going to use this, but at least I confirmed it works.</p>

<p id="p143"><strong>Ultra-wide selfies and the front-facing camera.</strong> In addition to Center Stage, you can use the new ultra-wide front-facing camera on iPad Pro to take ultra-wide selfies. I mostly appreciate the inclusion of the ultra-wide front-facing camera for video calls and Center Stage, but it&rsquo;s good know I&rsquo;ll be able to take an ultra-wide iPad Pro selfie with friends if I&rsquo;ll ever find myself in such a predicament.</p>

<p id="p146">The new iPad Pro features a 12 MP front-facing camera, which is, in theory, an overall upgrade from last year&rsquo;s 7 MP camera. However, because this is an ultra-wide camera with a &fnof;/2.4 aperture compared to the 2020 model&rsquo;s camera with &fnof;/2.2 aperture, I&rsquo;m not surprised I find regular selfies taken on last year&rsquo;s iPad Pro more detailed and better lit than the ones taken in &ldquo;cropped mode&rdquo; with the ultra-wide camera on the 2021 iPad Pro (without expanding the full ultra-wide view). Last year&rsquo;s selfie camera let in more light, but wasn&rsquo;t an ultra-wide lens; in order to support Center Stage and an ultra-wide capture, Apple had to sacrifice selfie quality slightly this year.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="Here's the technical readout provided by the Halide app for the front-facing camera on the 2020 iPad Pro (left) and the 2021 model." src="https://cdn.macstories.net/image-11-1621350753803.jpeg" /><p class="image-caption">Here&rsquo;s the technical readout provided by the Halide app for the front-facing camera on the 2020 iPad Pro (left) and the 2021 model.</p></div>
<p id="p148">The trade-off makes sense to me: the iPad&rsquo;s front-facing camera is mostly used for video calls, and I find having Center Stage more useful than marginally superior picture quality without Center Stage.</p>

<p id="p150">Considered in isolation, each of the major hardware changes to the 12.9&rdquo; iPad Pro is an outstanding achievement that highlights the technical prowess of the iPad&rsquo;s hardware team.</p>
<p id="p151">The Liquid Retina XDR display brings extreme dynamic range to photos and movies, with vibrant colors and black levels that are almost comparable to OLED; it&rsquo;ll be interesting to see how quickly this display tech can trickle down to other Apple devices. Thunderbolt has the potential to unify the accessory ecosystem story across the Mac and iPad; its data transfers are ridiculously faster than USB 3.2 and I&rsquo;m happy I can use the iPad Pro with my Thunderbolt dock now. With the M1 chip, faster internal storage access, and 16&nbsp;GB of RAM, I feel confident that this iPad Pro is future-proof and and ready to age well for the next couple years, just like the 2018 iPad Pro did.</p>
<aside class="pull-quote aligncenter" id="aside152"><blockquote>
<p>The new iPad Pro feels ready to power the next few generations of iPadOS.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside><p id="p153">The problem is &ndash; an iPad is more than the sum of its hardware parts, and I can&rsquo;t evaluate these features in isolation without considering how iPadOS takes advantage of them. It&rsquo;s hard to gauge the impact of the new iPad Pro right now: as I argued in this review, we may be on the cusp of major changes to iPadOS; aside from a few specialized third-party apps, I struggled to find iPadOS features that truly pushed the M1 chip, Thunderbolt, or the 16&nbsp;GB of RAM in this model.</p>
<p id="p154">I look at this iPad Pro and marvel at its display, all-day battery life, Center Stage&rsquo;s integration with the ultra-wide camera, and M1 chip. But, at the same time, I wonder: where are Apple&rsquo;s pro apps &ndash; the same ones I <em>can</em> use on an M1 Mac &ndash; such as Logic, Final Cut, and Xcode? Are there even third-party apps that can use 8 or 16&nbsp;GB of RAM on the App Store? Why can&rsquo;t I drive an external display over Thunderbolt by putting <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-13-the-macstories-review/21/" rel="noopener noreferrer">multiple app windows</a> on it? Why is Split View still so clunky and limited to two concurrent apps? These are all old questions; the new iPad Pro forces me to ask them again because the divide between iPad hardware and iPadOS is too great at this point.</p>
<p id="p155">Aside from superior picture quality and color reproduction, at this stage the new iPad Pro hasn&rsquo;t meaningfully improved anything in my daily workflow. It feels like there&rsquo;s a missing second half to this product&rsquo;s story. I&rsquo;m optimistic though: I suspect Apple is well aware of this too, and I&rsquo;d be <em>extremely</em> surprised if iPadOS goes without any major, foundational updates for another year. The new iPad Pro feels ready to power the next few generations of iPadOS; compared to such advanced hardware, however, the current version of iPadOS seems like it was made for three iPads ago.</p>
<p id="p156">At times, the 2021 iPad Pro feels like driving a Ferrari in your neighborhood&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_end_(street)" rel="noopener noreferrer">cul-de-sac</a>. We need new roads. We need iPadOS 15 to be the leap forward for the iPad platform we&rsquo;ve been waiting for. That this new iPad Pro is especially waiting for.</p>
<p id="p157">Maybe &ndash; just <em>maybe</em> &ndash; we only need to wait <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-announces-that-wwdc-2021-will-be-online-only-again-from-june-7-11/" rel="noopener noreferrer">two more weeks</a>.</p>

<p id="p2">Students are finishing up the year here in the US, and nothing says graduation season like a relative gripping an iPad with two hands to snap photos of a graduate at a family gathering. It&rsquo;s easy to poke fun at iPad photography, but those aren&rsquo;t easy shots to get with Apple&rsquo;s tablet. Both of your hands are occupied, and the viewfinder is huge and partially obscured by the app&rsquo;s UI. If you&rsquo;re at one of these events and see a relative struggling to take the perfect family portrait with their iPad, before you assume that they cut you out of the frame on purpose, show them <a href="http://halide.cam/download" rel="noopener noreferrer">Halide</a>. The brand new iPad version of the app from the team at Lux makes taking iPad photos more natural and, of course, offers all the advanced features available in the iPhone version of the app.</p>
<p id="p3">I don&rsquo;t take many photos with my iPad, and I doubt I ever will. The camera hardware isn&rsquo;t as good as it is on the iPhone, and I don&rsquo;t find myself in situations where I have my iPad but not my iPhone. However, once in a while, I&rsquo;m using my iPad and want to capture a moment quickly without digging my iPhone out of my pocket. For those occasions, I&rsquo;m going to use Halide because the app&rsquo;s thoughtful design makes the experience far superior to other camera apps I&rsquo;ve tried on the iPad.</p>
<p id="p4"><!--more--></p>
<p id="p5">I&rsquo;ve covered the iPhone version of Halide before, so I&rsquo;m going to focus on what makes the iPad version of the app unique. For more on the many pro-level photography features in Halide, be sure to <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/halide-review-instantly-better-photography/" rel="noopener noreferrer">check</a> <a href="https://www.macstories.net/ios/halide-1-7-brings-new-depth-photography-and-arkit-features-darkroom-integration/" rel="noopener noreferrer">out</a> <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/halide-introduces-smart-raw-for-iphone-xs-joining-a-host-of-other-improvements/" rel="noopener noreferrer">our</a> <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/halide-1-14-adds-new-lens-switching-interface-and-guides/" rel="noopener noreferrer">past</a> <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/halide-mark-ii-review-the-convenience-of-computational-photography-and-flexibility-of-raw-in-an-elegant-camera-app/" rel="noopener noreferrer">reviews</a>.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="With a swipe down on the controls beneath the shutter button, three more are revealed." src="https://cdn.macstories.net/ivborw0kggoaaaansuheugaaclaaaaeacayaaac7j4iiaaaacxbiwxmaabylaaawjqfjuitwaaalgmluwhrytuw6y29tlmfkb2jl-2-1621340130437.PNG" /><p class="image-caption">With a swipe down on the controls beneath the shutter button, three more are revealed.</p></div>
<p id="p7">Halide solves the two-fisted iPad death grip by placing the most commonly used controls right under your thumb. The shutter button sits at the midpoint of the right edge of the iPad by default. Beneath it are grid, histogram, and auto white balance buttons and a downward-facing caret. With a downward swipe anywhere beneath the shutter button, three additional controls are revealed: flash, timer, and settings. You don&rsquo;t need to precisely tap the caret to reveal the controls either. Halide uses a &lsquo;sloppy swiping&rsquo; gesture, which is perfect when you&rsquo;ve only got your thumb available for controlling the app. When you&rsquo;re done with the controls, swipe up to hide them away again.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="Halide for iPad can be configured for left-handed people." src="https://cdn.macstories.net/image-1621340034108.png" /><p class="image-caption">Halide for iPad can be configured for left-handed people.</p></div>
<p id="p9">The interaction with the shutter button and six controls arrayed beneath it is handy, but my favorite feature is the degree of customization offered. The biggest revelation for me was swapping the side of the screen on which the controls appear. I&rsquo;m left-handed and moving the shutter button and other controls to the left side of my iPad immediately made taking pictures feel more natural. Also, even if you don&rsquo;t want to switch the controls around, give it a try because the animation as the controls switch from one side to the other is delightful.</p>
<p id="p10">Moving controls from one side of an app to the other isn&rsquo;t new. It&rsquo;s common in a lot of drawing apps, but I haven&rsquo;t seen it in many apps beyond that category and never in a camera app. Not every app would benefit from swappable controls, but I hope Halide&rsquo;s clever implementation encourages other developers to consider whether their apps would benefit from leftie customizations too.</p>
<p id="p11">Halide&rsquo;s customization options extend to the UI beneath the shutter button too. By default, the viewfinder grid, histogram, which can be toggled between a mini and much larger iPad-appropriate size, and white balance controls sit below the shutter button. However, from Halide&rsquo;s settings, you can promote the flash or timer buttons, so they are always visible onscreen. The remainder of Halide&rsquo;s controls are found along the edge and in the corners of the screen, where the buttons follow the iPad&rsquo;s curved corners.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img alt="Halide's Pro View pulls the viewfinder in from the iPad's edges to make it easier to compose a shot." src="https://cdn.macstories.net/image-1621340063687.png" /><p class="image-caption">Halide&rsquo;s Pro View pulls the viewfinder in from the iPad&rsquo;s edges to make it easier to compose a shot.</p></div>
<p id="p13">The other issue Halide solves with its iPad app is one that I hadn&rsquo;t ever considered. There&rsquo;s a double arrow button in the corner of the screen that activates Halide&rsquo;s &lsquo;Pro View.&rsquo; Tap it, and the viewfinder shrinks into the center of the screen, allowing a clear view of the shot you&rsquo;re framing.</p>
<p id="p14">The Lux team says that iPads are typically held closer to your face when framing a shot, making it harder to take in the full scene when the viewfinder extends to the edges of the screen. The issue is compounded when controls obscure part of the view. I&rsquo;ve only had one day to use Halide&rsquo;s iPad app, but I immediately preferred the smaller viewfinder, which makes framing a shot easier without being so small that it&rsquo;s hard to make out details.</p>
<p id="p15">Halide for iPad isn&rsquo;t going to turn me into an iPad photographer. However, I&rsquo;ve been to enough graduation parties and sightseeing destinations on family vacations to know there are plenty of people for whom the iPad is their camera. For them, I&rsquo;m glad Lux has gone to the trouble to build an app specifically designed for the iPad&rsquo;s hardware and the way it&rsquo;s used. You won&rsquo;t find another camera app that&rsquo;s been so carefully crafted with the iPad in mind.</p>
<p id="p16">I&rsquo;m also glad that I&rsquo;ve got Halide as an option on my iPad. The controls are customized for the iPad, but will be familiar to anyone who has used Halide before. I may not use it often, but it&rsquo;s great to know the app is available on the iPad when I want it.</p>
<p id="p17">The iPad version of Halide <a href="http://halide.cam/download" rel="noopener noreferrer">is available for download on the App Store</a> as a universal purchase along with the iPhone version of the app. New users can try the app for free and then subscribe or purchase Halide for a one-time payment.</p>

    <p>Pauline Kael, reflecting on her career <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1994/03/21/the-movie-lover">in <em>The New Yorker</em>, 1994</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My pieces belong to the breakneck era before people could rent videos of old movies and before distributors began to supply reviewers with videos of new movies. (Reviewers can use the video as a text.) I wrote at first sight and, when referring to earlier work, from memory. This had an advantage: urgency, excitement. But it also led to my worst flaw as a writer: reckless excess, in both praise and damnation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of my problems as a writer in recent years is that I approach my words with too much caution. Deliberation is one word for it. Procrastination is another.</p>

<p>The urgency and excitement Kael writes about is something that has long been missing from my process; I wonder, often, how to get it back.</p>

    </p></div>
    <p><em>The candler blog</em> is <a href="http://candlerblog.com/2009/03/23/welcome-to-the-candler-blog/">now twelve years old</a>. I sat down recently to write a little about it, only to realize I was saying the same stuff I had said on the site’s <a href="http://candlerblog.com/2014/04/02/five-years/">fifth</a> and <a href="http://candlerblog.com/2019/03/23/ten-years/">tenth</a> anniversaries. So I just started reading my old work.</p>

<p>In my trip down memory lane, I came across a document I had forgotten about titled “Candler Manifesto.” This was something I had written to be the first post on this site, but ultimately never published. It explains my original intention: a website about movies written by people who make them.</p>

<p>“Critical practitioners,” I called the people I wanted to write here. As in people who worked in movies for a living but would turn a critical eye to them for pleasure. “Rather than give in to the coldness of the process, we will use our experience to find a greater appreciation of the cinema.”</p>

<p>Lofty, but not entirely untrue. My work in film and television does influence how I view works. Weirdly, my experience writing here about non-cinema things has also influenced my professional life. The tech and productivity articles that have proven more durable on this site have seeped back into how I do my work. If <em>the candler blog’s</em> cinema beginnings seem strange to the modern reader, it doesn’t feel all that strange to me.</p>

<p>Why a manifesto? I don’t know. Sounds creepy to me now. I think I was going for something along the lines of the <a href="http://www.dogme95.dk/the-vow-of-chastity/">Dogme 95 “Vow of Chastity”</a> when I titled it, something bold and attention grabbing. I don’t think the piece backs up the title, but you can be the judge of that.</p>

<p>In the end I didn’t publish it because, well I don’t know. It felt like the sort of thing that would be accompanied by a real editorial plan, which I didn’t have. I sent the piece to friends in hopes they’d want to write for the site. <a href="http://candlerblog.com/2009/12/30/the-sunrise-10-of-09/">Some did</a>, but most just sort of said it was a neat idea and moved on.</p>

<p>Eventually I just decided to start the site and go by the seat of my pants. That, I think, was the right decision, but I do wonder what would have happened if I really had built <em>the candler blog</em> of this forgotten piece, <a href="http://candlerblog.com/manifesto/">which I have finally published for all to see</a>.</p>

    <p>Annalee Newitz, parsing a variety of issues at Substack, <a href="https://thehypothesis.substack.com/p/heres-why-substacks-scam-worked-so">this week</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Substack’s business is a scam. They claim to offer writers a level playing field for making a living, and instead they pay an elite, secret group of writers to be on the platform and make newsletter writing appear to be more lucrative than it is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Me, <a href="http://candlerblog.com/2013/12/16/medium-confusion/">in 2013</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What if I told you you could be published alongside writers from (but not in) <em>The New Yorker</em> for the low low price of free? In a nut, that’s Medium: a slick, magazine-like publishing and reading platform that writers should be so lucky to contribute to.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t get the whole newsletter thing, so I never really bothered to figure out how Substack works. Sounds like it’s Medium, <a href="https://doyles.substack.com/p/in-queers-we-trust-all-others-pay">but worse</a>.</p>

    <p>A nice thing about having written a blog for awhile is I can go back and see if my younger self has an answer to a current dilemma. Here’s me, <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/04/20/text-and-death/">9 years ago</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Life is short and the considerable time I spend wondering which app has the best Markdown implementation is time thoroughly wasted. Write more, shop less; all of this will end someday.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oof. As the kids say, I feel seen.</p>

<p>To my younger, apparently wizened, self I say to hell with it. I’m going to ponder the dumb question of how I write anyway.</p>

<p>Jason Snell kinda opened this whole thing back up for me with a piece on his <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2021/03/searching-for-the-perfect-ios-markdown-writing-tool/">search for the perfect iOS writing tool</a>. His issue is that he can’t quite find a solid iPad app that comports with his Mac writing workflow. My problem is that I don’t even have a decent writing workflow on my Mac anymore. It’s all just gotten away from me.</p>

<p>I used to push text around from folder to folder, app to app, without much care about how it got there. Dropbox, for the longest while, was the linchpin of such operations. Then, at some point, I started preferring library type apps, like <a href="https://ulysses.app">Ulysses</a>, <a href="https://getdrafts.com">Drafts</a> and <a href="http://candlerblog.com/2016/08/25/elegy-for-vesper/">Vesper</a>. I loved being able to dash off a note and know it would be saved somewhere. I didn’t even need to name the files; there were no files, practically speaking.</p>

<p>But it wasn’t to last. My Ulysses library has grown bloated. A bad sync years ago has left me with multiple copies of a ton of sheets, and no easy way to weed out the duplicates.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Drafts, similarly, has become a silo of disorganization, a messy hoard instead of a manageable archive.</p>

<p>And so I am drawn to the idea of keeping my writings organized on disk instead of loaded in a library. At present, I have no idea how to do this. Should the files just be named whatever I want to call them, or have date-based filenames? Should I make a bunch of subfolders with dates? How granular? It’s a processn…</p>

<p>These days, on the Mac, I prefer writing in <a href="https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/">BBEdit</a> for reasons I can’t quite explain. It just has a certain solid feel to it, the kind of feeling that great Mac apps have. Organically, I’ve found over the last few months I just end up there. Most any note I have to jot down or text I have to paste, it’s happening in BBEdit.</p>

<p>So, assuming I settle on a naming organization, the questions become: where do I save these files and how do I access them on my iPhone and iPad? iCloud Drive seems to work well enough for saving. It even retains the different versions of the file so I can go back in time and see if I scratched out a brilliant idea.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>As to working with documents on other devices, I’ve been messing around with <a href="https://taio.app">Taio</a>. It’s a powerful app, but something is missing. I don’t quite know how to explain it. In exactly the same way BBEdit feels solid Taio just…doesn’t.</p>

<p>I don’t know, I’m still tinkering with it. Around every corner writers (including, to an extent, Snell) are recommending <a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a>. I haven’t used it <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2013/12/23/no-thanks-ia/">since the whole patent thing</a>, but maybe it’s worth another look on iPad.</p>

<p>If I ever settle on a form of document organization, I’ll need apps to conform to my system and not the other way around. Maybe soon I’ll wrap my head around all this and have a better writing workflow. Yeah, that’s it; it’s just around the corner.</p>

    <p>Why don’t I write <em>the candler blog</em> anymore? This is a question I think about often. Is it because I’m too busy at work? Or I have less to say of late? Maybe it’s that my writing workflow has broken down. Could that be it?</p>

<p>All of these reasons are true. But all have been true before.</p>

<p>I’m increasingly convinced that the reason I don’t write <em>the candler blog</em> anymore is that I don’t write <em>the candler blog</em> anymore. Publishing this is one step in changing that. Hello again.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been wanting to create my own crossword puzzles since I was a kid, but never quite got around to it. Earlier this year I decided to renew my commitment, and tweeted a bold claim:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Mark my words: within 3 months I'm going to publish my first self-constructed crossword puzzle, and within 3 years I'm going to have one published in the New York Times.</p>
<p>&mdash; Daniel Jalkut (@danielpunkass) <a href="https://twitter.com/danielpunkass/status/1265072881563848705?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 26, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see, June, July, August. Yup, I missed that target. But FOUR months later, I&#8217;m ready to catch up, and share the very first puzzle I&#8217;ve ever completed. I call it &#8220;Three Podcasts and a Blog&#8221; because I set out to build a puzzle around the &#8220;theme&#8221; of names of podcasts in the Apple developer/technophile scene. Only after I was almost done with the puzzle did I realize I&#8217;d included one blog that, in fact, has no podcasting counterpart. You&#8217;ll see the clue marked &#8220;oops!&#8221;</p>
<p>If you want to solve the puzzle, I encourage you to download and use my own Mac app, <a href="https://red-sweater.com/blackink/">Black Ink</a>. If you don&#8217;t have a Mac or would prefer to solve on paper, I&#8217;m also including a PDF so you can download and print it:</p>
<p><a href="https://bitsplitting.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ThreePodcasts-2.puz" title="Three Podcasts Across Lite">Download Across Lite Puzzle</a></p>
<p></a></p>
<p><a href="https://bitsplitting.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ThreePodcasts.pdf" title="Three Podcasts PDF">Download PDF Puzzle</a></p>
<p>Seeing as this was my first foray into the art of puzzle-crafting, I&#8217;m sure there will be lots of issues with the puzzle. Hopefully it&#8217;s still fun, especially for folks who are acquainted with Apple-related podcasts and blogs. Let me know what you think!</p>

    </p></div>
    <p>For a few days now I’ve been messing around with <a href="https://tot.rocks">Tot</a>, the new app from The Iconfactory. Smarter minds than mine have <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/tot-review-collect-and-edit-bits-of-text/">put it through</a> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/02/tot">its paces</a> if you want a more traditional review. The short explanation is: Tot is a scratchpad for Mac and iOS with seven notes. It’s <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/stickies/welcome/mac">Stickies</a> only way better.</p>

<p>I wasn’t looking for a new scratchpad app. I’ve never really used sticky notes, be they digital or physical, to great effect. Tot is not here to solve problems I have. And yet I am drawn to it. I <em>want</em> to use it. That feels huge.</p>

<p>Almost everything I write these days, I write on paper. Since I’ve been publishing so little, I rarely write digitally unless it’s work-related (emails, documentation, spreadsheets, etc.). This is due, in part, to a breakdown of my workflow. Putting a new app through its paces turns out to be the perfect opportunity to try to refine, and really re-establish, my digital writing habit.</p>

<p>When I was writing a lot, I wrote almost everything in <a href="https://ulysses.app">Ulysses</a>. I still love it, but I find myself less inclined to fire it up to do some leisure writing. The years-long corpus in there makes me second guess the inclination to use it as a scratchpad. This, of course, is all in my head; a blank sheet in Ulysses is no different than an empty note in Tot. It just doesn’t <em>feel</em> the same. Tot feels friendlier, less imposing. I’m writing in it right now.</p>

<p>I’ve tried so many apps for just jotting things down over the years. <a href="https://getdrafts.com">Drafts</a> works to a degree, but I don’t like using the Mac app.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/">NVAlt</a> never fully clicked with me, though the concept has always had a certain allure; we’ll see if the <a href="https://nvultra.com">forthcoming nvUltra</a> is a good fit. <a href="https://agenda.com">Agenda</a>, well I don’t actually understand how to use Agenda. Apple’s own Notes app is far too busy for me to fully commit to; it solves none of my problems and instead creates new ones. When I open BBEdit there will always be loads of untitled documents with scattered bits of text, but I’ve never found a great way to actually organize that system in a meaningul way.</p>

<p>Vesper probably came the closest to a notes app I enjoyed using every day. Of course it had no Mac app and lacked some basic comforts, but its simplicity was part of the draw. It’s one of the only tagging systems I’ve ever actually committed to. When <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2016/08/25/elegy-for-vesper/">Vesper shut down</a>, I transferred my notes, tags and all, to Ulysses, but I never ended up using it the same way. I just stopped taking those kinds of notes. In a way, Tot hearkens back to Vesper. As simple as possible, beautifully executed.</p>

<p>I use a great deal of paper. There are nights when I sit down before bed to write a page in my planner. I may switch over to write for a bit in a <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com">Field Notes</a> memo book before, if there’s anything left in my mind, opening a larger notebook to fill a page or two. Across the different books, I’ll repeat myself. I’ll mention that I had written a similar thought in one of the other books.</p>

<p>None of this is efficient or even particularly useful; it’s rarely productive. What can I say? I like to write. Not in the sense that I like to be published (I do) or that it brings me joy to compose a coherent thought (it does). I’ve found that sometimes, most of the time, I actually just like to write.</p>

<p>I like to write with pencils and pens and different colored inks. I take notes at the movies. Over a beer, I may take out a pen to get down a funny thing a friend said. In meetings, sometimes, I will rest a notebook on my laptop (probably open to a note-taking app) to jot down a few important points. Writing is just something I do a lot.</p>

<p>I used to like writing digitally, but life has changed for me. Maybe I write less on a computer because I stopped having fun doing it. A new notebook is a small investment that adds a little jolt of happiness into my life. Changing the ink in my pen is a cheap excuse to actually sit down and commit something to the page. Perhaps on a computer what’s been missing has been just a little extra delight.</p>

<p>Tot is a fun app that has already made me rethink how I write. On both Mac and iOS, it is a great place to focus on just your words. The sync is rock solid thus far, and on both platforms it feels completely stable.</p>

<p>Here’s something unique I haven’t heard much made about: Tot syncs cursor position and text selection. If you’re working on a long note on your Mac, launching that same note on your iPhone will open it at the same spot. If text is selected on iPhone, it is also selected on Mac. I haven’t seen this in any other text editor, but it’s instantly useful for me. I wrote this piece in Tot across two dots, switching from Mac to iPhone continuously as my schedule allowed. Having it always launch right where I left off is huge.</p>

<p>A few stray thoughts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tot on iOS is called Tot Pocket, but I just call it Tot because the two versions have feature parity save for one thing: you can’t change the Markdown font on iOS</li>
  <li>Speaking of Markdown, I am fine with the stripped down version Tot uses, but I hate underscores and prefer emphasizing text with single asterisks</li>
  <li>For some reason the iOS documentation leaves out the fact that Tot can be automated through the same URL scheme available on the Mac. I’m thinking up some shortcuts for lists I plan to keep in Tot</li>
  <li>Folks are well on their way to <a href="https://github.com/zrzka/tot-addons">adding more automation to Tot on the Mac</a></li>
  <li>The dock icons on the Mac are gorgeous and I wish iOS allowed automatic icon switching to match</li>
  <li>I’d like fot the Quick Keys palette to offer regular characters like a hyphen or an ampersat, since I actually use them, but I realize I can just access them from the keyboard </li>
</ul>

<p>Tot is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tot/id1491071483">free on the Mac</a> and costs <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tot-pocket/id1498235191">$20 on iOS</a>. That’s the cost of a few notebooks and less than a box of <a href="https://blackwingpencils.com">Blackwings</a>. Other apps are cheaper, but so what? Using Tot is a joy. It has made a space for itself in my life and, in turn, I have made the time to write. What is that worth?</p>

    <p>When <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-news/">Apple News</a> debuted, I was intrigued to learn that virtually anybody <a href="https://www.icloud.com/newspublisher/">can submit their own blogs</a> for inclusion in the service. Why not allow Bitsplitting, the <a href="http://red-sweater.com/blog/">Red Sweater Blog</a>, and <a href="https://indiestack.com">Indie Stack</a> to be part of this service? For reader who enjoy Apple News, it could serve as a kind of substitute RSS reader.</p>
<p>Apple did, in fact, accept my news sources, and for the past several years these articles have been available through the service.</p>
<p>I guess I&#8217;ve dropped the ball a bit as a blogger, though, because this week I received a terse email from Apple:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Daniel Jalkut,</p>
<p>We noticed that you have not published to your Bitsplitting channel in three months or more. Your channel will be removed in one week.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
The Apple News Team</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regards, indeed. Apple will drop me in one week if I don&#8217;t publish something, or maybe even if I do; the wording is ambiguous. I&#8217;m a little annoyed at this, but I&#8217;m also a little annoyed at myself for not blogging more frequently, so I guess I&#8217;ll just say: &#8220;thanks, Apple News!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Manton Reece <a href="https://micro.blog/manton/8208097">notes on Micro.blog</a> that there may be a less encouraging rationale for Apple&#8217;s crackdown on inactive publications:</p>
<blockquote><p>
@danielpunkass If you hadn&#8217;t heard, Apple News dropped RSS support for new blogs, and it sounds like they rarely approve personal blogs anymore. Weeding out inactive blogs could be the first step to removing them altogether.

    <p>Long-time Mac users will remember an app called &#8220;Key Caps&#8221;, which later become &#8220;Keyboard Viewer&#8221;, a feature of the Mac that is now accessible via the menu bar&#8217;s &#8220;Input Methods&#8221; item.

<p>I don&#8217;t use the Keyboard Viewer often, but when I do, it&#8217;s a real life-saver. I brought it up recently while I was debugging an issue with keyboard shortcuts in <a href="https://red-sweater.com/fastscripts/">FastScripts</a>, my scripting utility app. The Keyboard Viewer not only reflects every bona fide keystroke you make on a hardware keyboard, but also allows you to simulate keystrokes by tapping on the keys of the on-screen keyboard.</p>
<p>On macOS 10.15 Catalina, Apple has evidently dramatically overhauled the Keyboard Viewer. I don&#8217;t see any hint of this on the Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/catalina/features/">marketing sheet</a> for the OS, but this is what the Keyboard Viewer looks like on my Mac now:</p>
<p><img alt="NewImage" border="0" src="https://bitsplitting.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DefaultKeyboard-1.png" title="DefaultKeyboard.png" width="600" /></p>
<p>Well, isn&#8217;t that spiffy? But what I really want to talk about is that little Gear Button in the upper right corner of the window. Click it, and this what you get:</p>
<p><img alt="Popup menu with various options for customizing keyboards" border="0" height="323" src="https://bitsplitting.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/KeyboardPopup.png" title="KeyboardPopup.png" width="277" /></p>
<p>A whole slew of options for tweaking the behavior of the virtual keyboard, and an enticing &#8220;Customize&#8230;&#8221; item at the bottom. When you select it, a dedicated application called &#8220;Panel Editor&#8221; opens up. It&#8217;s essentialy a construction set for building virtual keyboard layouts:</p>
<p><img alt="Custom keyboard editor with silly bitsplitting.org keyboard layout" border="0" src="https://bitsplitting.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/BitsplittingKeyboard.png" title="BitsplittingKeyboard.png" /></p>
<p>This example is obviously comical, but the point is you can create and layout tappable regions that correspond to whatever keystrokes you desire. The options for configuring these keys even include options to perform multiple keystrokes, open apps, run scripts, etc. It&#8217;s a powerhouse of utility superpowers.</p>
<p><strong>How did they possibly find time to add all this great functionality in one OS upgrade? They didn&#8217;t.</strong> Folks who are familiar with Apple&#8217;s Accessibility Keyboard have no-doubt recognized my screenshots as being familiar from past OS releases. I personally had never seen it before, but it&#8217;s been hiding in the System Preferences Accessibility tab. What happened in macOS 10.15 Catalina is that Apple has evidently recognized its superiority in all ways to &#8220;Keyboard Viewer&#8221; and allowed the Accessibility Keyboard to simply take its place.</p>
<p>This is an excellent example of software being designed to assist people with specific needs, yet <em>actually being useful to everybody</em>. That is the heart of accessible software design, and I think we&#8217;ll see more and more &#8220;accessible&#8221; software released from the relative obscurity of the Accessibility tab as we move forward.</p>

    <p><aside><strong>Update:</strong> Since I first published this article, feedback from folks at Apple who should know has led me to believe the issue is not as dire as I laid it out below. The crude &#8220;contracts need to be signed&#8221; error message may be returned for any account type that has not yet agreed to the latest &#8220;Apple Developer Program License Agreement.&#8221; While this contract could change, and require an updated agreement, it seems less likely to change as frequently as the App Store agreement. I believe it was a mistake for me to assume that shipping apps with Developer ID + notarization would require agreeing to &#8220;App Store&#8221; contracts.<br />
</aside>
<hr />
<p>In the years since Apple released the iPhone, with its &#8220;locked-down-by-nature&#8221; approach to application security, the company has progressively chipped away at the freedoms Mac developers have historically had to do, more or less, whatever the heck they wanted.</p>
<p>With the introduction of the Mac Application Sandbox in 2012, Apple applied an iOS-like mechanism through which applications are entitled only to access their own data, and must explicitly request permission from Apple to access any resources &#8220;outside of their own sandbox.&#8221; At the time, I wrote that while the technology was promising, <a href="https://red-sweater.com/blog/2324/fix-the-sandbox">it left much to be desired</a>.</p>
<p>Around the same time, they introduced Developer ID, a system for certifying at runtime that a given piece of software has been cryptographically signed by a developer whose identity is known to Apple. Applications that are not signed with Developer ID are allowed to run in macOS, but by default are met with a foreboding warning about the safety of doing so. The component of macOS that is responsible for limiting the launch of software from unknown developers is called &#8220;Gatekeeper.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last year, in 2018, Apple introduced a new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing_your_app_before_distribution">notarization service</a>, an expansion of Developer ID functionality. Developers submit their applications to Apple, where they are scanned for known malware, and have their use of specific system technologies vetted. The &#8220;notarization&#8221; on an app allows the system to verify at runtime that a given application passes a baseline safety metric for downloaded software.</p>
<p>Finally, in 2019, Apple announced that software signed with Developer ID certificates, that is to say all non-Mac App Store software, must also be notarized. The Catalina 10.15 public beta identifies software that has not been notarized as potentially risky because it &#8220;cannot be scanned for malware.&#8221;</p>
<p>In effect: developers who ship software directly to end-users are now required to notarize their apps.</p>
<p>While working on the notarization process for my own apps, and a company I work for, I noticed an interesting error from &#8220;altool&#8221;, the command line program that is used to submit binaries to Apple for verification:</p>
<pre>
1 package(s) were not uploaded because they had problems:
Error Messages:
To use this application, you must first sign in to 
iTunes Connect and sign the relevant contracts. (1048)
</pre>
<p>The error is easily worked around by logging in to App Store Connect and agreeing to any updates Apple has recently made to their contracts. I&#8217;m so used to more-or-less blindly agreeing to these changes, that it didn&#8217;t sink in for me at first what a potentially major change this is.</p>
<p>My colleague <a href="http://www.hieper.nl">Patrick Machielse</a> noticed right away what the larger implication is: all Mac software, inside or outside of the Mac App Store, can now be held up by unsigned contract agreements with Apple. In a rush to fix a horrible bug and get it out to customers? Better review that new contract ASAP.</p>
<p>For the past 35 years, any Mac developer who wanted to ship an update directly to customers could do so by recompiling a binary and distributing it. When macOS 10.15 ships this fall, the status quo will change. Mac developers must register with Apple and sign their products. They must submit their binaries to Apple for notarization. And most significantly of all, they must agree to the terms of Apple&#8217;s App Store developer contracts, even if they don&#8217;t distribute their apps through the App Store.</p>

    <p>For a long time I have admired the <a href="https://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> project, for developing such a robust blogging platform that is ultimately open, and free, and anybody can contribute improvements to it. I encourage many of my customers to use WordPress with <a href="https://red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a>, because it seems like a &#8220;safe bet&#8221; going forward.</p>
<p>My admiration has diminished a bit in the past 7 months because &#8230; I haven&#8217;t succeeded in contributing to it.</p>
<p>For a long time, I heard reports from my customers that dates were being set wrong in posts to WordPress. The issue in summary is that if you have a draft post on WordPress, changing its status to &#8220;Published&#8221; doesn&#8217;t update the publish date from the time the draft was originally saved.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t really get a handle on this problem until it started affecting me. Sometimes I write the show notes for my podcast, <a href="https://coreint.org">Core Intuition</a>, ahead of the time the podcast actually goes public. In these situations, the blog post has a published date corresponding to the time I first starting writing the post, and when we finally go to publish the podcast, the date remains the same.</p>
<p>I did the hard work of not only diagnosing the problem in WordPress&#8217;s source code, but also writing a fix, and writing unit tests to confirm the fix. I filed a bug with a patch that will fix the problem for my customers, and any other clients of the WordPress API:</p>
<p><a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/45322">#45322: Editing a draft post with wp.editPost causes its published date to be set</a></p>
<p>Shortly after filing the bug, I went to the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">WordPress Slack</a> to see what I could do about having my fixes integrated. I was lucky to have a positive response from a couple members of the WordPress team, and my bug fix seemed slated for integration.</p>
<p>Time passed. I wondered. I didn&#8217;t want to nag the hard-working members of the team, but I also didn&#8217;t want <em>my hard work</em> to have been for naught. Also, my customers, as well as other clients of the WordPress API, would benefit from this.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been on my TODO list for 7 months now to &#8220;check in&#8221; with the WordPress team about this. Unfortunately, every time I do, the only thing I&#8217;ve noticed is that nobody substantially responds to my inquiries. I&#8217;m in the dead zone.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think the WordPress team is bad, by any means, but I think this reflects a problem in their process. When somebody comes to your project with a well-thought-out, unit-tested fix, and is met by radio silence? The chances are high that they will never come back again. I have submitted WordPress patches in the past, but after this experience I don&#8217;t know if I will bother submitting them again. That&#8217;s a big change in my perspective on how the WordPress team works, and on how it should work.</p>
<p>This post is about WordPress, but I think there are lessons for every open source project. Obviously, you can&#8217;t coddle every contributor. Some submissions will be bogus, some will be contrary to the aims of the project. But mine was a clear fix to a defect that affects multiple clients of the API. If it&#8217;s not a clear fix, I&#8217;m at least owed an explanation for why it hasn&#8217;t been committed after 7 months. In. My. Humble. Opinion.</p>

    <p>Over on Twitter today, I was inspired to ask people to write &#8220;just one blog post&#8221; today:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Everybody, join me in writing just one blog post today, to get that independent feeling back. <a href="https://t.co/bDFpxiVfqO">https://t.co/bDFpxiVfqO</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Daniel Jalkut (@danielpunkass) <a href="https://twitter.com/danielpunkass/status/1131915132794286080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 24, 2019</a></p></blockquote>
<p>  </p>
<p>Later, it occurred to me that after 10+ years on Twitter, I am privileged to have a substantial following. I thought I would take the opportunity to help promote some folks who don&#8217;t have as much immediate reach:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Did you write a blog post TODAY? Tweet it to me within then next hour, and if it's not offensive, I will retweet it. Long live the indie/open web!</p>
<p>&mdash; Daniel Jalkut (@danielpunkass) <a href="https://twitter.com/danielpunkass/status/1132003318493065216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 24, 2019</a></p></blockquote>
<p>  </p>
<p>I tagged all my retweets to those responses with <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LongLiveTheOpenWeb?src=hash">#LongLiveTheOpenWeb</a>. I think it turned out to be a pretty cool cross-section of bloggers, and I sort of editorialized the kind of blogging that people were doing.</p>
<p>I think people neglect to write blog posts because the feedback loop is not as tangible as the onslaught of (sometimes mechanical) likes or faves that you can receive on a social network. With blogging, you need a little faith that you will gain an audience. And on the open web, you never know who might come along and expand your audience.</p>

    <p>These days, as the giant social networks behave more and more reprehensibly, many people are looking back to the &#8220;good old days&#8221; of the web, when self-published blogs were the primary means of sharing one&#8217;s thoughts.</p>
<p>Brian Warren has taken this enthusiasm, and combined it with his nostalgia for another classic resource: the links page. He&#8217;s created a new one called <a href="https://macopenweb.com">Mac Open Web</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A collection of open and indie Mac, iOS, and web apps that help promote the open web.</p></blockquote>
<p>The solitary page is jam-packed with links to resources for creating and perusing content on &#8220;the open web,&#8221; that is to say &#8220;the web.&#8221; If you&#8217;re sick of Facebook and Twitter owning your experience of what is still a hugely diverse and free global network, then spend some time investing in writing and reading on the web &#8220;the way we used to do it.&#8221;</p>

    <p>I don’t remember starting this website. I really don’t. What I remember, mostly, is learning web publishing while I had a decent amount of free time on my hands at one of my first jobs out of college. Once I figured out how to host my own blog, I transferred a bunch of my MySpace posts to <a href="http://poritsky.com">my personal site</a> and kept at it, writing reviews and observations regularly.</p>

<p><em>The candler blog</em> was an idea that incubated for years. The original concept was as simple as it was lofty: people working in the film industry writing about film. Think <em>Cahiers du Cinema</em> meets <em>Projections</em>, but for my film school friends. I had planned on calling it just “The Candler,” and I worked through a few ideas to print it, like a newsletter, before giving up on it.</p>

<p>Until one day I just up and started the site. No urls for “The Candler” seemed available, so I added “blog” to the name, worked up a design incorporating a recent photo of mine, and <a href="http://candlerblog.com/2009/03/23/welcome-to-the-candler-blog/">just put the thing online</a>. A full decade later, here it is, still going, at least in some fashion.</p>

<p>When I think on the impact this site has had on my life, I almost can’t believe it. It was through this site that I found my way into being an editor for Heeb Magazine, from there writing for a variety of different outlets. I’ve interviewed filmmakers and movie stars, I’ve covered film festivals and movie premieres. My writing here helped link me up with the team behind <a href="https://www.fountain.io/">Fountain</a>, the plain-text screenwriting syntax I played the smallest role in getting off the ground.</p>

<p>It was this site that opened the door to covering SXSW for me, which brought me to Austin a few times, giving me the confidence to actually leave NYC when the time came. So now I live in Texas, where I met my wife and set down roots.</p>

<p>It’s a strange thing. I’ve tried various advertising models on the site, and I’ve been paid for my freelance writing, yet I never found a way to make the site generate any meaningful income. I have worked in post-production all these years, maintaining (or trying to, at least) <em>the candler blog</em> through it all. This website has never been my livelihood, and yet it feels as though my career would be nothing without it.</p>

<p>For ten years this site has been my little plaything. To the readers who have been here this whole time, or have just showed up today: thank you for coming around to my little pocket of the web. You helped keep this little project going so many times, whether you knew it or not.</p>

<p>And so, it’s 2019. The web is certainly changing, but not so much that a simple blog can’t find a few readers. I’ll keep this thing going for as long as I can. I hope you’ll be back to see what I’m up to.</p>

    <p>As the dueling documentaries on Netflix and Hulu about the failed Fyre Festival went live, I knew I’d be goaded into watching at least one of them. I had no interest as the story seemed to have been told plenty of times already. And yet, as more and more friends started talking about it, I figured it was time to watch one.</p>

<p>I picked Netflix’s <em>Fyre</em>, directed by Chris Smith. The film dredged up a number of thoughts about documentary cinema and how we watch and process non-fiction media. Instead of reviewing the film itself or composing an essay, I decided to make my internal monologue a little more external.</p>

<p>So here is a conversation between myself and myself, parsing my feelings on the matter. If this isn’t helpful, I have only myself to blame.</p>

<p><strong>I’m wondering why you say you didn’t even want to watch either film on the Fyre Festival. The idea that you would balk at taking the time to watch a feel makes you sound rigid, incurious.</strong></p>

<p>That’s a fair point but not one that’s really going to change my mind. I would say it’s less that I’m incurious and more that I have a disinterest in watching something that I would rather read.</p>

<p><strong>Read?</strong></p>

<p>So many documentaries today, especially those that are made for television, feel as though they would be better served by a lengthy magazine article. I don’t see what the moving image adds to the story.</p>

<p><strong>I’m going to come back to your “made for television” sideswipe later…</strong></p>

<p>We can talk about it now…</p>

<p><strong>…I think you’re being obtuse when you say you don’t see what the moving image adds. It adds, of course, the moving image. It makes it sound as though you would discount the entire advent of cinema since, well, we have books and theater; why have a new thing?</strong></p>

<p>Except you’re exactly right. You’re agreeing with me without seeing it. The cinema is <em>not</em> literature, it is different. And so is the documentarian a journalist? Hopefully. But bringing pictures to a story, especially now that moving images are everywhere, is only part of it. There must be a story told through pictures, that could not be told another way. Documentary is not illustration, but illumination.</p>

<p><strong>So you do like documentaries?</strong></p>

<p>Of course!</p>

<p><strong>But you’re generalizing that most made today don’t meet your rigid standard?</strong></p>

<p>First of all, I should maybe clarify that my standard, my rigidity as you put it, is merely personal. This is whether or not I like these films, whether I think they’re worth my time to watch. They are a wildly popular form. Clearly no one cares if I dislike 90% or whatever of those that come out.</p>

<p><strong>What are some documentaries that you do like?</strong></p>

<p>Oh, any Frederick Wiseman, the Maysles. <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2010/03/14/sxsw-review-marwencol/">I loved <em>Marwencol</em></a>. <em>Queen of Versailles</em> was enjoyable.</p>

<p><strong>So direct cinema.</strong></p>

<p>Yes, I’m a fan.</p>

<p><strong>Should all documentaries be direct cinema?</strong></p>

<p>If they were, I’d be happier but documentary would still be a niche form.</p>

<p><strong>Okay you referred to <em>Fyre</em> as made for television…</strong></p>

<p>Sure.</p>

<p><strong>Are you making fun of it? In other words, are you trying to take it down a peg by suggesting it’s something other than cinema?</strong></p>

<p>Look, Netflix is a direct-to-video streaming service. This is not necessarily a judgement on the quality of the work, but this is how it works. If there were no awards screening requirements, no Netflix film would ever play in a theater. Why? Because they’re a television network. The proper way to experience Netflix is in the home or on a device.</p>

<p>We will quickly find ourselves in the weeds here, but whatever is on Netflix is television.</p>

<p><strong>Even…</strong></p>

<p>I know what you’re going to say and I guess, yeah, even <em>Roma</em>. I watched it on television. Most people did.</p>

<p><strong>And you think that takes something away from the experience?</strong></p>

<p>Who’s to say? Maybe I would have enjoyed <em>Roma</em> more in a theater. Maybe the same goes for <em>Fyre</em>. But we’ll see. Maybe this year a made for television film will win Best Picture.</p>

<p><strong>See you’re being difficult, clearly. You are trying to poke fun at <em>Roma</em>, a beautiful and cinematic film, because Netflix released it. Why can’t you just judge the film on its merits?</strong></p>

<p>Why isn’t a turtle a giraffe? No one knows. If calling the film that premiered on a television network made for television is bad, I don’t know how we’re supposed to talk about this?</p>

<p>The other end of this is: where do you draw the line? Is every moving image everywhere cinema? Are they all worth our time? Good luck catching up on all your YouTube…</p>

<p><strong>We are off track.</strong></p>

<p>Clearly…</p>

<p><strong><em>Fyre</em>…</strong></p>

<p>Yes. It’s just a dry retelling, with one exception: everything after the festival. They did a good job there. Finally, three-quarters into the film, we get to something interesting.</p>

<p><strong>So doesn’t that make it worth it then?</strong></p>

<p>You may have me there. But I’d much rather watch something else and not know the ending.</p>

<p><strong>And I feel the opposite.</strong></p>

    <p>It’s been quite an Ingmar Bergman January for me. I’ve been slowly working my way through <a href="https://www.criterion.com/boxsets/1427-ingmar-bergman-s-cinema">Criterion’s monumental box set</a> in chronological order. (I’ve only gotten as far as 1949’s <em>Thirst</em>.) Though I have not begun reading the gorgeous book of essays that accompanies the book, I did, by chance, have reason to read a little bit about Bergman.</p>

<p>The <em>New York Times</em>, for awhile now, apparently, has had a podcast devoted to its Book Review section called, aptly, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/book-review-podcast"><em>The Book Review Podcast</em></a>. Recently, the hosts welcomed the paper’s co-chief film critic A. O. Scott <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/books/review/podcast-unquiet-linn-ullmann.html">to discuss a new book</a> he reviewed, <em>Unquiet</em>. The novel is a work of fiction by Linn Ullman, the daughter of Bergman and actress Liv Ullman. Per Scott, it is not a salacious autobiography, but a thinly veiled retelling of a girl growing up with monumentally famous parents.</p>

<p>Liv Ullman, of course, is the star of many of Bergman’s most famous films, including my personal favorite (so far!), <em>Autumn Sonata</em>, a devastating but beautiful film. Linn, her daughter, is herself a celebrated writer, though apparently the subject of her parents has long been off limits. She does not, apparently, reveal much in <em>Unquiet</em>. Here’s how Scott <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/books/review/unquiet-linn-ullmann.html">describes it in his review</a>:</p>

    <p>At WWDC 2018, Apple announced with great fanfare that two beloved Mac apps, <a href="https://panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a> and <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html">BBEdit</a>, would be returning to the Mac App Store.</p>
<p>Each of these apps had departed the App Store years ago, citing various reasons, but chief among them the limitations of the Mac App Sandbox, which restricts the functionality of apps in the Mac App Store.</p>
<p>I was curious whether Apple made any specific concessions to these developers, and whether those concessions would be opened up to &#8220;the rest of us&#8221; or not.</p>
<p>Today, Panic launched <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/transmit-5/id1436522307?mt=12">Transmit 5 on the Mac App Store</a>. It&#8217;s a free download, and costs $24.99/year after an initial 7-day free trial.</p>
<p>I downloaded Transmit even though I own a copy of the direct-purchase version. I wanted an answer to my question, which I got, at least partially, by dumping the application binary&#8217;s &#8220;entitlements&#8221;, which represent the sandboxing exceptions that the app has received.</p>
<p>New to me among the entitlements is &#8220;com.apple.developer.security.privileged-file-operations&#8221;, which is a boolean value set to true for Transmit. I don&#8217;t see any Google results for this key, so I&#8217;m assuming it&#8217;s something new that was added for Panic (and maybe BBEdit), and which may or may not be documented in the future for use by other developers.</p>
<p>Another interesting entitlement is &#8220;com.apple.security.automation.apple-events&#8221;, which is <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/com_apple_security_automation_apple-events?language=objc">documented by Apple</a>, but only in the context of the new &#8220;Hardened Runtime.&#8221; This technology is aimed primarily at developers who are not developing for the Mac App Store, but who want to provide enhanced security for their customers. In that context, I believe this entitlement provides unfettered access to sending AppleEvents, excepting that in Mojave and later the app is still subject to fine-grained system alerts that require user approval for each application that is targeted.</p>
<p>In short: it appears that Transmit possesses at least two &#8220;official&#8221; entitlements that could be made available, or are perhaps already available, to other developers. One way to find out: add them to your app and submit it for approval!</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Thanks to Jeff Nadeau for <a href="https://twitter.com/jnadeau/status/1063179321987149824">alerting me</a> to the pertinent API that correlates with the privileged file operations entitlement. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsworkspaceauthorization?language=objc">NSWorkspaceAuthorization</a> can be used to request privileged file access from the user, and Apple includes a link for <a href="https://developer.apple.com/go/?id=workspace-authorization">requesting access</a> to the entitlement.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> It turns out my intrigue around &#8220;com.apple.security.automation.apple-events&#8221; was ill-founded. I assumed that a sandboxed app could use this entitlement to gain unfettered access to automating other apps, but in the case of a sandboxed app it turns out to work in conjunction with the existing &#8220;com.apple.security.temporary-exception.apple-events&#8221; entitlement, which requires enumeration of specific targets. Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/lapcatsoftware/status/1063186635603542017">Jeff Johnson</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/pfandrade_/status/1063189048443973634">Paolo Andrade</a> for talking me through my misunderstanding of the situation.</p>

    <p>In macOS Mojave, Apple introduced a number of new security features that impact the day-to-day use of the computer. Activities such as running scripts, or using apps that access private information, are altered now such that users are prompted with one-time permission-granting requests.</p>
<p>One consequence of these changes is that you can no longer access certain parts of your home directory from the Terminal. Don&#8217;t believe me? Try opening Applications > Utilities > Terminal, and run the following command:</p>
<pre>
ls ~/Library/Mail
</pre>
<p>In all previous macOS releases, this would list the contents of Apple&#8217;s internal Mail files. As a privacy enhancement, access to these files is now restricted unless apps have requested or been proactively granted access.</p>
<p>If you really wanted to regain access to these files via the Terminal, you have to grant the app &#8220;Full Disk Access.&#8221; This is a new section of the Security &#038; Privacy pane in System Preferences.</p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s fine. Now you can &#8220;ls&#8221; anything in your home folder, but <em>absolutely every other thing you run in Terminal</em> can as well. To grant myself the ability to list files in ~/Library/Mail, am I willing to grant the same access to every single thing I&#8217;ll ever run in Terminal?</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t earth-shattering: it&#8217;s been the case forever that tools you run in the Terminal have access to &#8220;all your files.&#8221; But the new restrictions in macOS Mojave shine a light on a problem: the bluntness of security restrictions and relaxations with regard to Terminal.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve run into a variation of this problem in the past. I use the excellent <a href="https://www.tripmode.ch">TripMode</a> to limit bandwidth usage when I&#8217;m traveling, and tethered to my phone. A consequence of this is that, unless I grant unlimited network access to Terminal, I can&#8217;t perform routine tasks such as pushing <a href="https://git-scm.com">git</a> changes to a server.</p>
<p>Ideally these permission grants would be applicable at the <em>tool level</em>, rather than at the application level. It would be better if I could say &#8220;let ls access my Mail&#8221; rather than &#8220;let anything I run from Terminal access my Mail.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t completely understand the limitations there, but I suspect that because commands in the Terminal are running as subprocesses of Terminal, there is some technical challenge to making the permissions apply at such a fine-grained level.</p>
<p>As an alternative, I wonder if Apple could introduce some kind of &#8220;Security Profiles&#8221; feature for Terminal so that individual windows within the app could be run when different permissions? This could build on Terminal&#8217;s existing support for &#8220;Profiles&#8221; which already support varying Terminal settings dramatically on a per-window basis.</p>
<p>With Security Profiles, a user would be configure an arbitrary number of named profiles, and security privileges acquired by Terminal would be stored separately for the active profile. Each profile would be considered by the system effectively as a different app. For example, given my uses of Terminal, I might set up a few profiles for the types of work I regularly do:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Personal</strong>: Everyday productivity tasks including running scripts, editing files in my home directory, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Administrative</strong>: Tasks that pertain to the overall maintenance of my Mac: examining system logs, delving into configuration files, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Collaborative</strong>: Tasks that involve installing and running third-party tools that I trust, committing to shared source repositories, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Experimental</strong>: Tasks that involve installing or running third-party tools that I am not familiar with and do not have a high degree of faith in.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are off the top of my head, and just to give an idea of the kinds of profiles that might make sense here. Switching between these modes would also switch the system&#8217;s active list of entitlements for Terminal. If I run a script that accesses my Calendar items from the &#8220;Personal&#8221; profile, the system would prompt me once to ask my permission, but never prompt me again <em>in that profile.</em>  When I switch to &#8220;Experimental&#8221; and run some unfamiliar third-party tool that tries to access my calendar, it would ask permission again for that profile.</p>
<p>I filed Radar #45042684: &#8220;Support a finer-grained permissions model for Terminal&#8221;, requesting access for this or something like it.</p>

    <p>In case you haven&#8217;t heard the news, Brent Simmons recently <a href="http://inessential.com/2018/08/31/netnewswire_comes_home">regained the rights</a> to NetNewsWire, the groundbreaking Mac news reader, which also happens to be the progenitor of <a href="https://red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a>.</p>
<p>I have been a fan of NetNewsWire since before Brent sold it to NewsGator. Since before NewsGator sold MarsEdit to me. Before they sold NetNewsWire to Black Pixel. For a long time.</p>
<p>After Black Pixel took the reins, they put a lot of effort into a massive overhaul of the app, modernizing the look and feel and adding a robust, in-house syncing mechanism. When they released NetNewsWire 4 in 2015, it seemed as though the future for the app was bright.</p>
<p>As nice as NetNewsWire 4 was, it also differed a lot from NetNewsWire 3. They pared back the feature set a lot, in ways that made switching inconvenient to me. So I soldiered on with 3.3.2, thinking that I would update to 4.x eventually.</p>
<p>I never did. For whatever reason, work on NetNewsWire seemed to stall, and I never found the updated version of the app to fit my needs. NetNewsWire 3 worked <em>just fine</em>. </p>
<p>The meaning of &#8220;just fine&#8221; started to shift as macOS changed underneath the app. Subtle bugs emerged, the app&#8217;s lower-resolution graphics started to look fuzzy, and the networking infrastructure of the app is from an older era that is failing to connect to some SSL servers. In short, it&#8217;s no longer the great app that it once was. One particular bug with the size of the &#8220;Clippings&#8221; folder icon has been bugging me <em>for years</em>:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of NetNewsWire showing blurry icons and a missized Clippings folder icon." border="0" height="189" src="https://bitsplitting.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NNW3Clippings.png" title="NNW3Clippings.png" width="467" /></p>
<p>Over the years I considered other news readers such as <a href="http://reederapp.com">Reeder</a> (which is free for a limited time, by the way), but none of them scratched that NetNewsWire 3 itch. I rely upon some arcane features of the app including &#8220;scripted feeds,&#8221; which allow me for example to run Python scripts on my Mac that connect to Twitter and generate RSS feeds from search results. That&#8217;s not possible in most feed readers.</p>
<p>I used to fantasize about getting access to the NetNewsWire 3 source code and sprucing it up. I wondered how things might have turned out differently if, in addition to acquiring MarsEdit from NewsGator, I had acquired both? I can&#8217;t say I would have done a better job than Black Pixel, but I would have <em>preserved the features I care about</em>, and that Clippings folder icon would be the right size!</p>
<p>Because Brent and I are still close friends, we have been in conversation about NetNewsWire and the various options for moving it forward into the future. I&#8217;ve also been contributing to the NetNewsWire <a href="http://github.com/brentsimmons/NetNewsWire/">open source project</a>, which is based on an entirely new code base unrelated to NetNewsWire 3.</p>
<p>Since I&#8217;m not the only stalwart NetNewsWire 3 user, one of the things Brent was curious about was whether he could give that version &#8220;one last hurrah,&#8221; so to speak. Fix a few of the most glaring bugs, build against a modern SDK, and not only create an artifact for history to more accurately judge the app&#8217;s virtues, but to give long-standing users something to tide them over while development continues on NetNewsWire 5.</p>
<p>I was honored when Brent handed me the keys to the castle, so to speak, by sending me a copy of NetNewsWire 3&#8217;s source code. To heavily paraphrase what he said, it was basically &#8220;let me know if it&#8217;s worth saving.&#8221;</p>
<p>I got the app building with Xcode 10 on macOS Mojave beta 9. There were some major glitches. The sidebar was pure black, fonts were rendering wrong. Probably whole subsets of functionality were not working, or working unreliably. I sent the source base back to him with a report that it builds and runs, but would probably take some work to get into shippable shape.</p>
<p>Brent made the pragmatic choice <a href="http://inessential.com/2018/09/04/decision_not_publishing_netnewswire_3_x">not to release</a> an updated NetNewsWire 3. Putting the bugs aside, he recognized that any time invested in that old version is an investment in older technology that does not have a viable future. It&#8217;s a distraction from the <a href="http://inessential.com/2018/09/02/new_world_netnewswire">New World NetNewsWire</a>.</p>
<p>To be honest, the decision doesn&#8217;t sting at all. I&#8217;ve switched most of my news reading to development releases of NetNewsWire 5, and only use NetNewsWire 3 for a handful of those geeky script-based RSS feeds I am still relying on.</p>
<p>I was grateful to have the opportunity after all these years to take a peek at the source code to the app, and to get a feel for what it would take to salvage what&#8217;s left. I couldn&#8217;t resist fixing at least one bug before I passed it along though:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of the NetNewsWire window with Clippings folder icon restored to normal size" border="0" height="187" src="https://bitsplitting.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NNWClippingsFixed-1.png" title="NNWClippingsFixed.png" width="445" /></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re curious: the Clippings icon is obtained from the Mac operating system. At one point in history it must have come from the system at just the perfect size to fit the source list in the app, but as Apple modernized and adapted to higher resolution Macs, they must have updated the icon to support drawing at much larger sizes. NetNewsWire 3.3.2 doesn&#8217;t manually set the size to the expected 16x16pt size, but 3.3.3j (for Jalkut!) does.</p>
<p>Goodbye, NetNewsWire 3. You were a great app, but your time has passed. Long live NetNewsWire 5.</p>

    <p>I wrote last month about macOS Mojave&#8217;s <a href="https://bitsplitting.org/2018/07/11/reauthorizing-automation-in-mojave/">restrictions on automation</a>, and how users can reset the database that controls them. In that post, I cited Felix Schwarz&#8217;s excellent article on the subject.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, Apple has made changes to the behavior of macOS Mojave, and added some API calls to help developers better handle the restrictions of the system. Felix is back with an <a href="https://www.felix-schwarz.org/blog/2018/08/new-apple-event-apis-in-macos-mojave">updated post</a>, describing the changes, and what he thinks can still be improved.</p>

    <p>The macOS Mojave betas include a significant enhancement to user control over which applications can perform automation tasks. When we talk about automation on the Mac, we usually think of AppleScript or Automator, but with a broader view automation can be seen as any communication from one application to another.</p>
<p>One ubiquitous example of such an automation is the prevalence of &#8220;Reveal in Finder&#8221; type functionality. For example if you right-click a song file in iTunes, an option in the contextual menu allows you to reveal the file in the Finder. This is a very basic automation accomplished by sending an &#8220;Apple Event&#8221; from iTunes to the Finder.</p>
<p>In the macOS Mojave betas, you&#8217;ll notice that invoking such a command in an application will most likely lead to a panel asking permission from the user. The terminology used is along the lines of:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;WhateverApp&#8221; would like to control the application &#8220;Finder&#8221;.
</p></blockquote>
<p>If the user selects &#8220;OK&#8221;,  the application sending the command will be thereafter whitelisted, and allowed to send arbitrary events (not just the one that prompted the alert) to the Finder. If you&#8217;re running macOS Mojave you can see a list of applications you&#8217;ve already permitted in System Preferences, under &#8220;Security and Privacy,&#8221; &#8220;Privacy,&#8221; &#8220;Automation&#8221;.</p>
<p>These alerts are a bit annoying, but I can get behind the motivation to give users more authority over which applications are allowed to control other applications. Unfortunately, there are a number of usability issues and practical pitfalls that come as side-effects of this change. Felix Schwarz made a great analysis of many of the problems <a href="https://www.felix-schwarz.org/blog/2018/06/apple-event-sandboxing-in-macos-mojave">on his blog</a>.</p>
<p>I ran into another usability challenge that Felix didn&#8217;t itemize: the problem of denying authorization to an application and then living to regret it. I guess at some point I must have hastily denied permission for Xcode (Apple&#8217;s software development app) to control the Finder. This resulted in a seemingly permanent impairment to Xcode&#8217;s &#8220;Show in Finder&#8221; feature. I&#8217;m often using this feature to quickly navigate from Xcode&#8217;s interface to the Finder&#8217;s view on the same files. After denying access once, the feature has the unfortunate behavior of succeeding in activating the Finder (I guess that one is whitelisted), but failing silently when it comes to revealing the file.</p>
<p>OK, that&#8217;s fine. I messed up. But how do I undo it? Unfortunately, the list of applications in the Security and Privacy preference pane is only of those that I have clicked &#8220;OK&#8221; for. There&#8217;s no list of the ones that I&#8217;ve denied, and no apparent option to drag in or add applications explicitly. For this high level problem, I filed Radar #42081464: &#8220;TCC needs user-facing mechanism for allowing previously denied privileges.&#8221;</p>
<p>What&#8217;s TCC? I&#8217;ll be darned, I don&#8217;t know what it stands for. But it&#8217;s the name of the system Apple uses for managing the system&#8217;s so-called &#8220;privacy database.&#8221; This is where these and other permissions, granted by the user, are saved. For instance, in macOS 10.13 when the system asks whether to grant access to your Address Book or Contacts, the permission is saved, and managed thereafter, by TCC.</p>
<h3>Resetting TCC Privileges</h3>
<p>I knew from past experience testing Contacts privileges in my own apps, that Apple supports a mechanism for resetting privileges. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s pretty crude: if you want to change the authorization setting for an application you&#8217;ve previously weighed in on, you have to universally wipe out all the privileges for all apps using a particular service. For Contacts, for example:</p>
<pre>
tccutil reset AddressBook
</pre>
<p>This completely removes the list of apps authorized to access Contacts. (The AddressBook naming is a vestige of the app&#8217;s former user-facing name.) In fact, if you type &#8220;man tccutil&#8221; from the Terminal, you&#8217;ll find that AddressBook is <em>the only service</em> explicitly documented by the tool. Fixing my Xcode problem is not going to happen by resetting AddressBook privileges. So what do I reset? I tried the most obvious choice, &#8220;Automation,&#8221; results in an error: &#8220;tccutil: Failed to reset database&#8221;.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the service called, and does tccutil even support resetting it? After a crude search of the private TCC.framework&#8217;s binary, I discovered I was looking for &#8220;AppleEvents&#8221;:</p>
<pre>
tccutil reset AppleEvents
</pre>
<p>After running this, I quit and reopened Xcode (the TCC privileges seem to be cached), and selected &#8220;Show in Finder&#8221; on a file. Voila! The Finder was activated and I was again asked if I wanted to permit the behavior. This time, I made sure to say &#8220;OK.&#8221;</p>
<p>You can get a sense for the variety of services tccutil apparently supports resetting by dumping the pertinent strings from the framework:</p>
<pre>
strings /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/TCC.framework/TCC | grep kTCCService
</pre>
<p>The list of matching strings includes names like AppleEvents and AddressBook, as well other names for things I don&#8217;t recognize, and a seemingly useful &#8220;All,&#8221; which can presumably be used to wipe out all authorizations across all services.</p>
<p>Because the tccutil is far more useful than is advertised, and because users are undoubtedly going to end up needing to reset services more than ever in Mojave, I also filed Radar #42081070: &#8220;Documentation and command-line help for tccutil should enumerate services.&#8221; There are some items in the dumped list that appear likely to be private to Apple, but anything genuinely useful to customers (or more likely, the consultants who fix their Macs) should be listed in the manual.</p>
<h3>Lighten Up, Eh?</h3>
<p>While I support the technical and user-facing changes suggested by Felix Schwarz in the previously linked blog post, some issues would be avoided by simply giving apps the benefit of the doubt for widely used, innocuous forms of automation.</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier that the Apple Event sent by Xcode to &#8220;activate the Finder,&#8221; was apparently whitelisted by the system. Evidently Apple saw wisdom in the thinking that simply causing another application to become active is unlikely to be widely abused. I think the same argument holds for asking the Finder to reveal a file. I filed Radar #42081629: &#8220;TCC could whitelist certain widely used, innocuous Apple Events.&#8221;</p>
<p>I mentioned before that I can support Apple&#8217;s effort to put more power into users&#8217; hands with this feature, but one side-effect of requiring the authorization even for innocuous events like &#8220;Show in Finder&#8221; is that apps that do not otherwise offer automation functionality to users will nonetheless require that users grant that power.</p>
<p>If the merit in the feature is to allow users to limit what kinds of automation apps can perform, then supporting a &#8220;Show in Finder&#8221; feature for an application should not require me to simultaneous permit it to do whatever kind of Finder automation it chooses to. For example, an application so-authorized is now empowered, presumably, to send automation commands to the Finder that modify or delete arbitrary user files.</p>
<p>These days Apple always seems to be pushing the privacy and security envelope, and in many ways that is great for their users and for their platforms. With a little common-sense and some extra engineering (&#8220;It should be easy&#8221; — Hah!), we can get the best of the protection these features offer, while suffering the fewest of the downsides.</p>

  <p>No use sugar-coating it: the federal government of the United States of America now has a policy of taking children away from their families when they attempt to enter the US to request political asylum from violence &amp; hardship in their native countries.

<p>Read his whole post, which goes through a series of news stories documenting the horrors from the border. Anyone who can hear these stories and feel nothing is beyond saving. It is important we bear witness to this evil. In my lifetime, in my <em>state</em>, the government has thrown children into cages, deliberately and without remorse. This will not be forgotten, and I don’t know how it can possibly be forgiven.</p>

    <p>On Monday Apple announced that they are officially supporting so-called &#8220;free trials&#8221; for non-subscription apps. The reaction has been a breathless celebration that Apple has finally relented and given developers something we&#8217;ve been asking, no begging, for since the dawn of the App Store.</p>
<p>But what really changed? Not much. Apple announced no functional changes to the way the apps are categorized, how pricing is conveyed to customers, or how the physical transaction of downloading, trialing, and potentially purchasing an app takes place. What they did announce is a change to the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#payments">App Review Guidelines</a>, adding a bullet item to section 3.1.1 describing a kind of ersatz substitute for actual free trials, built on the in-app purchase system:</p>
<blockquote><p>Non-subscription apps may offer a free time-based trial period before presenting a full unlock option by setting up a Non-Consumable IAP item at Price Tier 0 that follows the naming convention: “14-day Trial.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This change to the review guidelines is fantastic, because it will give app developers greater confidence that such a workaround will continue to be approved by Apple. But the practice of offering free trials in this manner is not new, and is not particularly great by any stretch of the imagination.</p>
<h3>The Origin of Ersatz Free Trials</h3>
<p>To my knowledge, the first developers to come up with the idea of using in-app purchases to approximate free trials were The Omni Group. In September 2016 they <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/blog/providing-the-best-possible-app-store-experience">wrote about a novel solution</a> for the long-standing absence of free trials (and upgrade pricing) on the App Store, which is based on providing a baseline free download and unlocking premium functionality through in-app purchases:</p>
<blockquote><p>With the original download free, we can implement any pricing options we want to offer customers through In-App Purchases. We can offer our standard unlocks of Standard and Pro, of course. But we can also offer a free 2-week trial which unlocks all of the features of Pro and Standard, letting you freely choose between them.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many of us who had also been waiting for App Store support for free trials and upgrades waited in anticipation to see whether it would really work. Would Apple actually approve such a use? Would customers understand it? Would the App Store Infrastructure reliably handle the approach? The answer, as it turns out, was yes. Sort of.</p>
<p>Omni&#8217;s approach worked well enough that developers of other apps soon followed suit. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mindnode-5/id1289197285?mt=12&#038;at=10l4LD">MindNode 5</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/acorn-6-image-editor/id1233861775?mt=12&#038;at=10l4LD">Acorn 6</a>,  and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sparkle-visual-web-design/id863015334?mt=12&#038;&#038;at=10l4LD">Sparkle</a> all launched as &#8220;free&#8221; App Store titles that can only be substantially improved with in-app purchases ranging from free, timed trials to paid, permanent feature unlocks.</p>
<p>The approach seemed to be gaining momentum so in mid-2017 as I was looking forward to the <a href="https://red-sweater.com/blog/3274/marsedit-4-is-here">release of MarsEdit 4</a>, I decided that I would embrace the same idea. Since December, 2017, I have sold MarsEdit 4 as a free app with in-app purchases for free trials, free upgrades for recent purchases, discounted upgrades, and full-price upgrades. In many ways the change has been a revelation. It&#8217;s a great relief to be able to offer my customers nearly as many trial and pricing accommodations as I can offer directly through <a href="https://red-sweater.com/store/">my own store</a>.</p>
<h3>The Problem with Ersatz Free Trials</h3>
<p>While I&#8217;ve enjoyed many of the upsides of the Omni approach, I&#8217;ve also had the opportunity to appreciate the many downsides. You might say it&#8217;s &#8220;a pretty sweet solution&#8221; for offering free trials.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s particularly important, in the face of all the celebration this week about Apple&#8217;s perceived changes to the App Store, to understand the many ways in which this solution falls short of what many developers still hope for: bona fide support for real free trials in the App Store.</p>
<p>In summary: <em>none of the mechanics of supporting ersatz free trials are substantially supported by the App Store.</em> Every aspect of the solution is bolted on to a system which was not designed for, yet is somewhat admirably being used to simulate real support for free trials. Let me elaborate by listing several shortcomings and how they affect both users and developers in significant ways. Just off the top of my head &#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Paid apps are listed as free, even though payment is required to unlock core functionality.</strong> This is confusing to many users and leads some to a feeling of bait-and-switch, and that they&#8217;ve been betrayed by the developer. This is particularly problematic with apps whose price points make them most suitable to free trials. MarsEdit is $50, so some users who download the &#8220;free app&#8221; are understandably annoyed when the first thing they learn is that it will cost a significant amount to unlock it.</li>
<li><strong>Bulk purchase programs are unavailable.</strong> Apple&#8217;s <a href="https://volume.itunes.apple.com/?l=en">Volume Purchase Programs</a> for business and education are based on a system of allocating a certain number of &#8220;primary&#8221; App Store products to an institution. In the case of a free app with paid in-app purchases, there is no mechanism by which a school or company can for example purchase 500 copies of MarsEdit from the App Store. They can &#8220;purchase&#8221; 500 free copies and then proceed to unlock each copy individually through the in-app purchase dialog in each app. This is a particularly unfortunate limitation for apps that are <em>uniquely suited</em> either to education or to business uses.</li>
<li><strong>Family sharing is unavailable.</strong> For the same reasons that bulk purchases are off the table, a developer who wants to allow families to purchase an app once and share it among their family&#8217;s devices and accounts is unable to do so unless they sell their app with a fixed, up-front cost in the App Store.</li>
<li><strong>Not applicable to all app types.</strong> Although Apple doesn&#8217;t explicitly state it in their revised App Review Guidelines, I strongly suspect that a continuing requirement for ersatz free trials is that the app must continue to function <em>in some way</em> as a perpetually free, unlocked app. For document-based apps such as Omni&#8217;s, they went with an approach whereby the app becomes a read-only document viewer when it is not paid for. In MarsEdit, I took a similar tack by allowing all features to function <em>except for publishing changes</em> to blogs. In many cases it is possible to contrive a free/paid functionality divide, but for some apps it would be very awkward, or maybe impossible to do so.</li>
<li><strong>Apps are ranked and featured in the wrong charts.</strong> A problem rooted in these paid apps being listed as free is that there is no natural place for them to be honestly ranked among the App Store&#8217;s two-tier division of apps into &#8220;Paid&#8221; and &#8220;Free&#8221; charts. An app that is $50 and sells very well will never make its way to the top of the &#8220;Paid&#8221; charts, and if it is lucky enough to beat out actually free apps in the free charts, it will only confound users who are surprised to learn that one of the top free apps actually costs money. The presence of a &#8220;Top Grossing&#8221; category provided a sort of compromise category for such apps, but Apple removed the ranking from iOS 11, and appears to be set to remove it from the Mac App Store in macOS Mojave.</li>
<li><strong>Transaction mechanics are pushed onto developers.</strong> One of the primary advantages of the App Store to developers is being able to get out of the business of managing direct sale transactions. With the paid-up-front approach, users browse the store, conduct a transaction with Apple, and download the app. In exchange for taking on this work, Apple is rewarded with a 30% cut. With ersatz free trials, almost every aspect of this complexity is pushed into the app, where developers have to laboriously devise a mechanism for conveying app limitations to users, blocking pertinent functionality, transacting an in-app purchase, facilitating the unlock of app functionality, and so on. </li>
<li><strong>Free trials cannot be easily reset.</strong> It is typical outside of App Store marketplaces for developers who offer free trials to periodically reset free trials so that users who, for example, enjoyed a free trial on version 1.0 of an app, can give it a fresh look on 1.1. The use of in-app purchases for accommodating free trials would, strictly speaking, require that developers perpetually add new SKUs to the App Store representing a different &#8220;free trial&#8221; product for each of the timeframes in which a developer wants to reset things.</li>
<li><strong>Apps cannot be made to &#8220;just work&#8221; out of the box.</strong> One of the main rationales for offering free trials is to get prospective customers to download <em>and start using</em> the great features of an app as quickly and with as little effort as possible. With ersatz free trials a customer must first authorize Apple to <em>allow the download of the free app</em>, and then they must commence a confusing in-app purchase process during which they will be asked again whether they want to start a free trial.</li>
<h3>Real Free Trials</h3>
<p>Now that I&#8217;ve listed a number of significant problems with ersatz free trials, let&#8217;s talk a little bit about what real support in the App Store might look like, and how it would alleviate the problems I&#8217;ve described.</p>
<p>For starters, real free trials would allow developers who currently list their apps as &#8220;free&#8221; in the App Store to list them by their actual price.  The App Store could convey that information both more honestly and more informatively to users. Instead of &#8220;Free with in-app purchases,&#8221; MarsEdit could be identified succinctly as &#8220;$49.95 with 14-day free trial.&#8221; These apps would no longer be erroneously featured among free apps, but would rank alongside other paid apps, where they belong.</p>
<p>Having a bona fide price associated with the main App Store SKU would re-open access to the bulk purchase programs and family sharing. You know you want 500 copies of MarsEdit for your company? Go ahead and purchase 500 copies. The fact that the App Store <em>happens to support free trials</em> would be irrelevant to your conducting this transaction with Apple.</p>
<p>Real free trials would open the functionality up to any developer who chooses to participate, regardless of their app&#8217;s functionality. Instead of forcing developers to come up with arbitrary lock-downs on functionality in the app, they would simply flip a switch in App Store Connect, ideally specifying a trial duration. When free trials are downloaded from the store, the receipt would have the trial information baked right in.</p>
<p>Putting the logic in the store itself would also empower developers to start or stop offering free trials whenever they like, and to reset free trials across the board with major updates, in the same way they can choose to reset star ratings today. And <em>all the tedious mechanics</em> of offering, transacting, and enforcing free trial limitations would obviously be back in Apple&#8217;s court, where they can efficiently support such functionality in <em>one place</em> instead of requiring every developer to re-implement the same kind of support in every app.</p>
<p>Finally, and probably equally importantly to users and developers alike, real free trials would enable users to effortlessly download and use <em>all the features of an app</em> without having to labor through any of the administrative tedium that is currently required by ersatz free trials. Happy customers trying excellent apps and ultimately paying for them is something that we can all get excited about.</p>
<p>I hope this article has been helpful in illustrating why Apple&#8217;s review policy announcements, while very welcome indeed, do not constitute a major shift in their support for free trials in the App Store, and do not substantially change the status quo. Many of us are stretching the limits of the App Store to provide something that comes close to real free trials, but we would all be far better off if Apple announced a substantial change in supporting them. That didn&#8217;t happen this week.</p>

    <p>A few weeks ago I was asked by Stephen Hackett to contribute a story, to his <a href="https://512pixels.net/membership/">members-only newsletter</a>, about my early experiences with computers and/or with the Mac. I was happy to help Stephen out because he does great work at 512 Pixels, because he is a friend, and because I like to talk about myself.</p>
<p>I agreed with Stephen that my contribution would be exclusive to his newsletter for a few weeks, and that afterwards I could publish it on my own blog. Here it comes!</p>
<p>Stephen&#8217;s version in the newsletter was spruced up with cool pictures of the mentioned computers, and possibly edited in ways that made me sound better than I do here. This is the raw, uncut version. Enjoy!</p>
<hr />
<p>I&#8217;ve been a rabid Mac user and developer for 25 years, so it&#8217;s fair to say I&#8217;ve been a part of this community &#8220;for a long time.&#8221; But in my heart, I still consider myself something of a newbie. After all, I didn&#8217;t get my first Mac until I was 18 years old. My entire childhood was spent using, enjoying, even obsessing over computers made by other companies.</p>
<p>In 1982, I was 7 years old and lived with my mom in the rural town of Dunsmuir, California. While Silicon Valley&#8217;s famous fixation with technology was well underway, it hadn&#8217;t substantially reached the folks in my small, relatively poor home town. Meanwhile, my dad was living separately from us in Santa Cruz. He had gone back to school as an older student to obtain a computer science degree, and started his professional career working for IBM in San Jose. His enthusiasm for computers would turn out to be crucial to my interest in computers, and to my eventually programming them.</p>
<p>On one of his visits, he brought my first computer: a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timex_Sinclair_1000">Timex Sinclair 1000</a>. It was barely the size of a small book, used a television set for a display, saved files to audio cassette tapes, and featured a whopping 2KB of RAM. It&#8217;s fascinating that even the content of this article I&#8217;m writing would not fit in the memory banks of that computer. My dad gave me some copies of Compute! magazine, which featured BASIC program listings, some of which I guess were applicable to the Timex Sinclair. One of my earliest programming memories is of him walking me through the rough notion of source code as a sequence of instructions, and the computer as the obedient executor of those commands.</p>
<p>That Timex Sinclair wasn&#8217;t much of a machine, but it may still have made me the very first person in Dunsmuir to own a &#8220;home computer.&#8221; Apart from typing in the occasional program from those magazines, I never really learned to program it. But having those computing concepts introduced when I was so young, and in such a fundamentally hands-on way, set me up for the deeper understanding of computers and programming that I would later gain.</p>
<p>In 1983, my mom and I moved to Santa Cruz to live with my dad. In the Bay Area, we were far from the only family with a home computer, but my dad&#8217;s enthusiasm certainly meant our home saw a greater variety of them than most! My dad bought me a Commodore 64, which I adored, but the real thrill was his <a href="http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_1156670">Kaypro IV</a>. This beast was a semi-portable, all-in-one computer that ran the CP/M operating system, and featured a monochrome green display. I&#8217;d sneak onto it while he was out of the house, scouring his piles of floppy disks for anything of interest. I spent hours playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladder_(video_game)">Ladder</a>, a Donkey Kong-like game whose graphics consisted entirely of ASCII characters animated on the screen.</p>
<p>When the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_1000">Amiga 1000</a> was released in 1985, my dad bought one, and I threw myself completely into it. I experimented with programming, studying the <a href="https://archive.org/details/1990-beats-steve-amiga-rom-kernel-ref-3rd">&#8220;ROM Kernel Manual&#8221;</a>, but never learned how to put together a whole program. Still, for many years, I was &#8220;an Amiga guy.&#8221; I met other Amiga users, traded software, and reveled in the various technically superior capabilities of that platform.</p>
<p>Through the Santa Cruz BBS community, I got hooked up with an extensive network of UC Santa Cruz computer nerds, and found my way onto the internet by around 1989. That&#8217;s how I fell in love with UNIX. Throughout my teenage years, I played with various UNIX systems through the Adm&#8211;3A terminals in the university&#8217;s computer labs, and eventually ended up owning both a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun-3">Sun 3/50</a>, and an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SGI_Indigo">SGI Indigo</a>. Obviously, I loved computers, but in spite of my diverse experience with various systems, I&#8217;d never really learned to program, and I&#8217;d never really used a Mac.</p>
<p>By 1993, I had a few friends through the Santa Cruz computer scene who were then working at Apple, about a 45-minute drive away. <a href="http://omino.com">David Van Brink</a> was a software engineer on the QuickTime team, and he opened my eyes to the virtues of the Mac. As much as I had enjoyed other computers, from that Timex Sinclair, through the Amigas, UNIX systems, and occasional other platforms, I had never witnessed a computer seeming particularly empathetic to its users. The Amigas came closest, but even at their most charming, they were obviously <em>meant for nerds</em>. The Mac, I finally came to realize, truly was &#8220;the computer for the rest of us,&#8221; and I was ready to become one of us.</p>
<p>David shared his employee discount with me and, after convincing my dad it would be useful for my college work, I came up with the cash for my very first Mac: a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerBook_Duo_210">PowerBook Duo 210</a>. This curious machine came from an era when Apple supported the notion of a &#8220;dockable&#8221; computer that could be used as a portable, but also plugged in to a desktop case connected to a full monitor, keyboard, etc. I could only afford the computer itself, so I made do with its limitations, but it was marvelous. Finally, more than 10 years after first being introduced to programming and computers, I owned a Mac, and was eager to write software for it.</p>
<p>I used a program called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/THINK_Reference">THINK Reference</a> to study the Macintosh Toolbox API, and got to work writing my first app, <a href="https://red-sweater.com/blog/131/vintage-code">Super Robots</a>, which was a blatant clone of a text-graphics based app for UNIX called &#8220;robots.&#8221; (Fun fact: because the PowerBook Duo had a grayscale screen, I developed and shipped the app without ever having seen it for myself in full color.)</p>
<p>After shipping an app, and becoming vaguely familiar with the Mac operating system, I took the step that would ultimately be most impactful on my career and life-long love of computers: I went to work for Apple! At the encouragement of <a href="http://queue.com">Qarin Van Brink</a> (David&#8217;s sister), I applied at a Silicon Valley contract agency that was known to supply many of Apple&#8217;s QA testers. A few improbably successful interviews later, I was working in Cupertino on the System 7 integration team.</p>
<p>I eventually made my way out of testing and into engineering, where at long last, I started to sort of maybe learn to program. I also started learning how to really use and appreciate the Mac, and how to empathize with users. Compared to many Apple fans, I was late to the Mac party, but I&#8217;ve been making up for lost time. For 25 years, I devoted myself to using and programming Macs. Here&#8217;s hoping I can eke out at least another 25!</p>

    </p></div>
    <p>A few years ago, my photography workflow broke. I can’t remember exactly when, but there was a sort of cascading effect once it became clear Apple didn’t want to support Aperture anymore.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> From there I stopped bringing my Nikon D90 around with me, and my photo collection began to wither.</p>

<p>When Apple first showed off the iPhone 7 Plus with the dual-lens camera and Portrait Mode, it blew me away. I wanted it to become my new, everyday camera. It has been, but until recently was using it exactly as I had all my other iPhones; it didn’t feel like a camera. Two apps, <a href="https://halide.cam">Halide</a> and <a href="http://www.usedarkroom.com">Darkroom</a>, have changed that for me. I’m having a total blast taking photos again.</p>

<p>The key feature of deluxe camera app Halide, for me, is speed. When you take a photo, you feel a little haptic feedback. The screen doesn’t blink or freeze frame. On to the next shot. It feels almost like shooting with a Leica or other rangefinder. You compose the shot, set focus and exposure, then move on.</p>

<p>If you’ve never shot with a rangefinder, this may seem a bit abstract. With an SLR, you can see what the shot will look like when you compose it; with a rangefinder, you can’t (exactly).<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> The result is that you end up training your eye to see what your next photo will look like without looking through an eyepiece. Halide has basically gotten me into that sort of thinking. I’m more dexterous with it than I ever was in Apple’s built in Camera app.</p>

<p>Of course, Halide has a bevy of other features. It can shoot RAW, has manual controls like ISO and shutter speed, and it even has its own take on Portrait Mode, called Depth. I’ve used a number of beefed up camera apps over the years, and Halide is easily the most intuitive to use.</p>

<p>The main feature that blew me away was shooting RAW. Halide’s designer, Sebastiaan de With, <a href="https://blog.halide.cam/the-power-of-raw-on-iphone-part-1-shooting-raw-ef02becb7002">has an excellent series on the topic</a>, but here’s a quick example that made me want to shoot everything RAW. Halide allows you to shoot both RAW and JPG, the latter of which will have all the noise reduction and color correction the built in Camera app offers. This is a 100% crop of a photo I took as a JPG.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.candlerblog.com/images/2018/03/jpg-crop.jpg" title="JPG Crop" /></p>

<p>Now here’s the same photo in RAW.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.candlerblog.com/images/2018/03/raw-crop.jpg" title="RAW Crop" /></p>

<p>In this example, the RAW version retains <em>a lot</em> of information that the JPG does away with. Sure, there’s noise, but beneath that noise is a ton of detail. The boats look sharper and each of the cables on the bridge are more distinct in the RAW version. Here’s the whole shot, as edited in Darkroom.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.candlerblog.com/images/2018/03/full-pic.jpg" title="The Full Photo" /></p>

<p>Darkroom is a fantastic photo editing app that just released a huge update. Besides the photo adjustment tools the app has been honing over the years, they’ve added the ability to adjust the depth map on Portrait Mode photos. This means you can increase or decrease the amount of blur behind your subject. They’ve taken it a step further, allowing you to adjust the edges of what is in the foreground and in the background. <em>And</em> you can even do things like adjust the saturation, brightness and contrast of the foreground and background separately.</p>

<p>I’ve been using the beta for a little while, and this makes Portrait photos a ton more fun to play with. I find that, more often than not, I’m reducing the amount of blur. Portrait mode tends to treat most photos as if they were taken with an 85 or 105mm lens, which is appropriate as these are often referred to as “portrait” lenses (get it?!). But Sometimes I frame a photo that feels a lot more like a 50 or even a 35mm lens. Pulling the blur back allows for a subtler effect mimicking a wider array of lenses. Here’s an example.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.candlerblog.com/images/2018/03/portrait-mode.jpg" title="A Portrait Mode Street Photo" /></p>

<p>The blur adds just enough separation between the subject and the background. This feels a lot more like a photo taken with a street lens, to me at least. It’s more blur than I would get with the lenses on their own, but less than what Apple’s algorithms tend to ask for.</p>

<p>One more portrait photo, taken amid the cacophony of a red carpet before the premiere of <a href="http://candlerblog.com/2018/03/20/isle-of-dogs-review/">Wes Anderson’s <em>Isle of Dogs</em></a> at SXSW.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.candlerblog.com/images/2018/03/goldblum.jpg" title="Jeff Goldblum before Isle of Dogs" /></p>

<p>I felt like I was pushing my phone to the limits, and didn’t think any depth information would show up at the distance I was standing. But somehow it does its little magic and grabs a fairly clean shot. I took some photos with my SLR as well; they’re much nicer, although since I was shooting into lights there was a lot of glare streaking over the subjects. The tiny iPhone lenses didn’t seem as phased by that. But honestly it was just fun to try to get a shot like this on my phone.</p>

<p>There are loads of other features in both of these apps. If you want to read more on them, I suggest <a href="https://www.macstories.net/ios/halide-1-7-brings-new-depth-photography-and-arkit-features-darkroom-integration/">Federico Viticci’s recent Halide walkthrough</a> or <a href="https://medium.com/the-bergen-company">Darkroom’s own blog</a>. Though made by different companies, they go hand in hand. Each even has the ability to jump to the other app with a single tap.</p>

<p>I still love taking photos with my Nikon D90, but there’s no question that my iPhone is now my main camera. Halide has reinvigorated my little hobby, and Darkroom has made it so I can turn my snapshots into something beautiful right from my phone. I’m excited to see what they add next.</p>

<p><a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/halide/id885697368?at=11l5Fb">Halide is $4.99</a> and <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/darkroom-photo-editor/id953286746?at=11l5Fb">Darkroom is free</a> with in-app purchases up to $7.99 (you’re going to want to just buy every feature). Go get them and take some great photos.</p>

    <p><img alt="Scene from Ready Player One" class="center" src="http://www.candlerblog.com/images/2018/03/ready-player-one.jpg" title="Ready Player One Still" /></p>

<p>Looking back on my own notes, it seems I enjoyed reading Ernest Cline’s novel, <em>Ready Player One</em>, more than I remember. Over time, it has hardened into a something I don’t particularly like. Beloved for its voluminous pop cultural references, I always found the crutch of stroking nostalgia got in the way of an otherwise straightforward story.</p>

<p>Enter Steven Spielberg, one of the great visual storytellers of our time. His filmed version, which I caught at its SXSW world premiere, cuts through the cruft and puts characters front and center. Fans need not worry, though, this is a faithful adaptation that only improves upon the original. If you wanted to wrap yourself in Cline’s universe, it just got a lot bigger.</p>

<p>The story, written for the screen by Zak Penn along with Cline, takes place in the year 2045. Seemingly all commerce revolves around the OASIS, a virtual reality game world that functions as a social outlet. People pick an avatar and live their lives inside of the game. Wade Watts, our hero played by Tye Sheridan, lives in “The Stacks,” a squalid makeshift slum so-named because it consists of RVs, trailers and cars stacked atop one another. Since the world has gone virtual, people seem to have adapted to living in less space.</p>

<p>Watts wanders around the OASIS trying to solve a puzzle hidden by James Halliday, the deceased creator of this digital universe, played by the incomparable Mark Rylance. This seems to be the focus of most OASIS users, the most dedicated of whom are called “gunters,” short for “easter egg hunters.” You see, Halliday’s game revolves around his own childish obsessions, coming of age in the 1980s as he did. The prize, total control of the OASIS, is so great that amateurs like Watts aren’t the only ones on the trail. A company called Innovative Online Industries, or IOI, has hordes of virtual mercenaries and indentured servants scouring the digital realm for clues.</p>

<p>This is the setup; it’s a lot to take in at once. Penn and Cline’s script stumbles along trying to bring you into this world, opening with an extended voice over imparting about as much as I just did. Cline’s universe has the potential to be rich, but he, as its creator, can’t help but get in his own way, trying to make sure you see how reverent he is to the past.</p>

<p>The result is a film that is fun to watch, leads nowhere and has little to say. Which is strange because it feels like, today, in 2018, we are at a technological inflection point, one that makes the future of <em>Ready Player One</em> feel rich with relevance. Cline’s 2045 is a hellscape, one in which humanity has given itself over not only to the whims of a few technological oligarchs, but to the corrosive force of nostalgia. I’ve long wondered what happens when a generation raised on “28 Things Only 90s Kids Will Understand” listicles edges into middle age and tries to look back. The result is something like this film: a world where no culture seems to have been created for a generation; everyone was too busy looking back.</p>

<p>Steven Spielberg is a unique figure to take on a project that deals so heavily in memory and the future. Not only has his work provided indelible portraits of our past, as in <em>Saving Private Ryan</em>, he also entered this century providing a template for the future with <em>Minority Report</em>. For that film, the director famously <a href="https://www.wired.com/2012/06/minority-report-idea-summit/">convened a symposium of technologists</a> in order to learn what technologies might actually be around in our lifetime. No such care seems to have been taken with <em>Ready Player One</em>, which seems to be all about hopping on a ride and never letting go. Weirdly, it fights against being a dystopic vision of the near future, despite the darkness right below the surface.</p>

<p>If Cline can’t help his indulgences toward fandom, Spielberg can’t help but compose incredible visuals. There are many scenes that cut back and forth between worlds real and virtual; his virtuoso eye for spatial details comes in quite handy here. The way armies of VR players are shown in multiple spaces will keep you thrilled, and certainly elevates the film to something stunning.</p>

<p>The film’s best set piece, which I won’t reveal but you’ll know it when you see it, is the closest Spielberg comes to having something to say about memory and nostalgia. We enter a well-trod universe that will not only reward those familiar with it, but may rewire the minds of those who haven’t experienced it yet. Once the film has been out for a bit, and perhaps after at least one more viewing, I will have plenty more to say on this.</p>

<p>Steven Spielberg is a director who can close up shop tomorrow and be remembered as one of the great directors of all time. And yet it is something of a gift to see him stretch out his creative muscles in this period of his career. He is clearly enjoying himself. He made the first Disney film of his career in 2016 with <em>The BFG</em>, and work is starting on a new <em>West Side Story</em>, which will mark a huge milestone in the director’s career (he has reportedly always wanted to make a musical). Something has changed in his approach to the projects he takes on. These years may well turn out to be his most fertile and active of his career.</p>

<p><em>Ready Player One</em> is at times thrilling, but it’s unfortunate it doesn’t have more to say. The stakes of the quest are completely out of whack, and the film’s resolution (and closing shot) feel incredibly weak given the scale of the world we imagine the OASIS to be. Spielberg, however, remains one of my favorite directors to watch from film to film. There are techniques at play here that I hope come up again in his other films. If nothing else it is fun, popcorn fodder. Perhaps that’s all we need to chew on right now.</p>

<p>The style and substance of Wes Anderson’s work is well established at this point. His films are colorful and symmetrical, each frame packed edge to edge with a reverential graphic aesthetic, a design language built atop modernist furnishings and drapery; he works with a revolving murderer’s row of comic powerhouses, his own little repertory of collaborators; and there will always be a great adventure, one where dangers abound and the wounds will cut just deep enough.</p>

<p>Yes, <em>Isle of Dogs</em>, which had its North American premiere this past weekend at SXSW, fits unmistakably in the Anderson canon; if you like his films you’ll continue to do so here. What is surprising, though, is that built atop the recognizable aesthetic is something I did not expect to find: a political message. In this sense, though perhaps not the most satisfying of Anderson’s work, the film may be his most exciting. Watching a filmmaker build on everything he knows and then step out of that comfort zone to say more than you may have expected provides a unique thrill.</p>

<p>The film takes place in the fictional Japanese city of Megasaki. It is ruled with an iron fist by a plutocratic, cat-loving mayor, Kobayashi (Kunichi Nomura, who also co-wrote the film’s story with Anderson, Jason Schwartzman and Roman Coppola), who whips the citizens into a frenzy over an outbreak of dog flu. Ignoring his opponents, doctors representing the Science Party, he banishes all dogs to Trash Island, a literal dump that has been polluted by various Kobayashi enterprises. We learn later that the mayor’s plotting has more to do with enriching himself than any ideological bent.</p>

<p>On Trash Island, we meet Chief (Bryan Cranston), Rex (Edward Norton), Duke (Jeff Goldblum), Boss (Bill Murray) and King (Bob Balaban), a pack of dogs that roam the refuse, searching for food scraps, longing for a purpose. Adventure presents itself when a young pilot, Atari (Koyu Rankin), crash lands on the isle, looking for his lost dog, Spots (Liev Schreiber). The pups are (mostly) game to help the young boy find his dog.</p>

<p>While most of Megasaki’s residents seem to have made peace with the expulsion of the dogs, there is a resistance movement afoot, led by a young foreign exchange student, Tracy (Greta Gerwig). Working for her school newspaper, she pulls at the thread of corruption that has led to the mass dog deportation. Tracy’s journalism quickly morphs into activism once she sees that adults around her have grown complacent. She springs into action, leading up to what has now become a classic Anderson fireworks display of a climax.</p>

<p>Politics has become, perhaps irrevocably, a dominant aspect of American daily life. It is fashionable to know the ever-growing cast of characters in the world of the political; opinions, however ill-informed, have become the coin of the realm. Personally, I am so inundated by news that I can’t tell if I’m merely impressing my own mental state, one awash in names and details and tick-tock reportage, upon this filn. I don’t think so, though. <em>Isle of Dogs</em> feels like a warning of where authoritarianism leads (and how to fight it).<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>While many evils are timeless and make for great cinema, Kobayashi feels like a unique villain for our era. Take your pick of kleptocrat, at home or abroad, and you’ll begin to see the similarities. He is made all the more difficult to defeat by the fact that he rose to power not despite the will of the people, but because of it. Only the children of Megasaki have the fortitude to stand up to such a foe. Such may be the case in real life as well.</p>

<p>As I’ve mentioned, the Anderson hallmarks are all there. The film’s plot burns nice and slow as we learn more about what makes each character (and there are many!) tick. Everything occurs in its rightful order, which is to say not always chronologically, for the biggest emotional impact. The result is a film sprinkled with perfectly executed moments of laughter, cheers and tears. It’s an all ages<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> escapade that will leave you with plenty to talk about when the lights come up.</p>

<p>Wes Anderson’s filmmaking journey is certainly never dull. One can always rely on him for a visual feast set to musical deep cuts (there’s plenty of vinyl, as well as what sounds like a new, or at least less heard, rendition of <a href="https://csosoundsandstories.org/prokofievs-score-for-the-film-lieutenant-kije-ahead-of-its-time/">Sergei Prokofiev’s first film score</a>) with moments of raw emotional revelation. That palette has become so second nature to the director, he can now imbue his stories with vital and current considerations. That may be the most impressive aspect of this latest outing. I, for one, am excited to see where he goes next.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>One can also discern a message of protecting the planet, though, weirdly, for a film set on a place called Trash Island, that seems to be somewhat secondary. <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2">
      <p>Perhaps now is a good place to mention that the film is not entirely in English. Every character speaks his or her native tongue, which means most humans speak Japanese. One should trust Mr. Anderson on this: English speakers will not be in the dark. There are no subtitles, but everything is made clear through some form of translation. Younger viewers, I would guess, likely won’t even notice the film feels foreign to any degree.<a href="http://www.candlerblog.com#fnref:2" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

    <p>Spike Lee’s <em>Pass Over</em> is a beautifully filmed version of a powerful play. At times it feels like a concert film. The audience is a central character, and not just in the theater. The film opens with scenes of young audience members preparing to get on busses to head to The Steppenwolf Theatre to see the play. We see as they get ready and we hear their laughter, their gasps, their concern.</p>

<p>Antoinette Nwandu’s play (directed for the stage by Danya Taymor) is about two young black men, Moses (Jon Michael Hill) and Kitch (Julian Parker), forever stuck on a Chicago block. Their existential threat is police violence. Almost everyone they know has been killed, so they stay on their block, passing the time talking about what they’ll do in the “promised land.”</p>

<p>The two have cooked up a sort of biblical mythos about life outside of the block. Old testament references abound (it is, after all, a play called “Pass Over” with a main character named Moses), but the concerns are immediate. Here, the promised land is a state of mind, a place where the threat of being gunned down doesn’t lurk around the corner. It’s also a place where you can order champagne on ice from room service. The two are not mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>Moses and Kitch aren’t the only characters on the block. There are two white men who come in and out of their lives. The first, Mister (played by Ryan Hallahan) is wealthy and aloof, decked out in full seersucker and hat, carrying a comically oversized picnic basket. He claims to be lost on the way to his mother’s house, and offers the bounty in his basket to the men. They are mistrustful, but they spend time with him, enjoying the food. He has all their favorites, after all.</p>

<p>The second is Ossifer (here played by Blake DeLong; on stage both parts were portrayed by Hallahan), a police officer who checks in on Moses and Kitch to keep them in their place. He is an unchecked racist, finding glee in using racial epithets and ensuring the men never leave the block.</p>

<p>The power of the film comes from the oscillations of racism between Mister and Ossifer. One is obvious, while the other is dangerous. Moses and Kitch come to learn that the threat of gun violence may be the least of their worries in this life. Maybe there is no promised land for two black men so long as the Misters of the world are out there, enjoying their picnic baskets.</p>

<p>Adding footage of the audience before the show is a disarming and brilliant conceit. It reminds the viewer that this performance is not just for them, but for a different audience, one that is mostly young, black and living through struggles similar to Moses and Kitch. There is much of the film that is extremely current (direct reference is made to Colin Kaepernick’s protests) and may not stand the test of time, but seeing the audience experience the play adds a timeless weight to the story.</p>

<p>The most important thing one can do when leaving <em>Pass Over</em> is discuss it. There is a great deal to unpack, and some conclusions may not be as obvious as one thinks. The real gift of Lee’s film is bringing this story to audiences around the world. See it when it’s available to you.</p>

    <p>When Apple&#8217;s flagship &#8220;Infinite Loop&#8221; headquarters was built in 1993, the name implied many promises of eternal iteration. Regrettably, none of these promises are likely to be fulfilled.</p>
<p>While it’s impossible to predict whether _some_ characteristic of the landmark might one day meet the standard, none of the most obvious candidates have passed the test:</p>
<ol>
<li>The buildings form a connected loop, so you can technically walk from one building, to the next, to the next, etc. This gives a feeling of an infinite sequence, but it&#8217;s apparent to anybody that there are in fact only 6 buildings, labeled IL1 through IL6. Add in IL7 if the Peppermill (now BJ&#8217;s) is accounted for, and you get seven. Seven is nowhere <em>close</em> to infinite.</li>
<li>Given the size of the building compared to Apple&#8217;s relatively modest Silicon Valley workforce, it seemed at one time that it might house infinite employees. As time wore on and Apple&#8217;s successes grew, the number of employees who could be packed into the buildings&#8217; narrow confines was shown to be &#8230; decidedly finite.</li>
<li>Lifers at Apple might have once expected to work a virtually infinite number of days (and nights) on the campus, but as time wore on it became evident that these people either retire or move on to other companies. Finally, the remaining hope for infinite workdays was dashed by the construction and opening of Apple Park, where many current Infinite Loop employees will now work.</li>
</ol>
<p>In fact Apple Park exceeds, by every reasonable measurement, the &#8220;infinite&#8221; aspirations of Infinite Loop. The extent to which one can walk around it infinitely is grander. The number of employees it can shelter, while shying considerably from infinity, is nonetheless greater. And the career longevity of folks who call Apple Park home today is, I&#8217;ll concede, about the same as it was at Infinite Loop.</p>
<p>The pragmatism in naming Apple Park is evident. In corporate headquarters, nothing is infinite. Not even for Apple. In naming this major headquarters upgrade, it makes no such allusions.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s the perfect name for a smaller hoop of a campus, residing a stone&#8217;s throw away from the mighty Apple Park? Apple Playground, of course. You&#8217;re welcome.</p>

    <p>I bought a HomePod, and have been using it lightly for about a week now. On the face of it, I&#8217;m the ideal customer: an Apple fan who&#8217;s invested in other Apple devices, subscribes to Apple Music, is more-or-less at peace with Siri, and is primarily in the market for a better sounding home audio speaker. Hello, HomePod! I couldn&#8217;t resist.</p>
<p>I unboxed it and installed it in our dining room. I tested it with some of my favorite music, by <a href="https://walkingwallofwords.com">Neutral Milk Hotel</a>. It sounded <em>fantastic</em> to my ears, and seemed to live up to all the hype. My decision to put it in a common room was exciting for my children, who are six and nine. The six-year-old danced around, piping semi-naughty utterances such as &#8220;Hey Siri, play <em>inappropriate</em> music,&#8221; before giggling maniacally and looking to me for a reaction.</p>
<p>Next, we enjoyed about eight repetitions from the theme song for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARTRJQfV90k">Milo Murphy&#8217;s Law</a>, a children&#8217;s show starring Weird Al Yankovic. The kids fought over which one got to &#8220;ask Siri&#8221; to play it again next. For a short while, it looked as though HomePod would be a welcome addition in our home, but it soon wore out its welcome.</p>
<p>I expected shortcomings, as anybody who&#8217;s been following news about the device should, but none of the expected problems were deal-breakers. Here&#8217;s how many of those issues affect myself and my family:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiuser Support.</strong> It doesn&#8217;t support multiple users. It does support &#8220;personal requests&#8221; for exactly one user, so anybody who lives with family or roommates, and <em>doesn&#8217;t want everybody to have access to their reminders, notes, etc.</em>, is compelled to turn off support for these requests.. Fortunately, Apple provides a setting for this and even asks during setup what the default should be. This is not a big deal to me, because I am almost always with my iPhone and Apple Watch, to which I make most of my &#8220;personal requests.&#8221; More on that later.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-HomePod Support.</strong> It doesn&#8217;t support multiple HomePods. Yet. Apple promised technologically stunning audio performance with the HomePod, and they seem to have delivered. It&#8217;s supposed to be <em>even better</em> if you can afford to purchase two or more HomePods and let them work in concert (har, har) with one another. Me, I&#8217;m just looking for one HomePod to sound great in one room, so I&#8217;m not too bothered.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Audio Input.</strong> HomePod can&#8217;t stream Bluetooth, you can&#8217;t plug an iPhone or any other USB device into it, and you certainly can&#8217;t pipe direct audio from RCA jacks or a headphone-style 3.5mm stereo jack. It can play music from your iTunes Music Library and Apple Music, or it can stream from an AirPlay-compatible device. This takes care of most my needs, but doesn&#8217;t cover all my wife&#8217;s wishes. We concluded we would need to keep our existing Bluetooth/USB playback device around as a backup plan.</li>
<li><strong>Siri is Siri.</strong> Let&#8217;s face it: much of the criticism is warranted. I rely heavily upon Siri, and on the whole I&#8217;m pretty happy with it. Which is not to say I am not frequently frustrated by its mistaken interpretations and unfathomable inabilities. Perhaps the most embarrassing incompetency, particularly for a device that should feel at home in a kitchen, is its continuing inability to manage <em>more than one timer</em> concurrently. Chalk it up to Stockholm Syndrome, but I&#8217;ve got all manner of mental workarounds for Siri&#8217;s quirks. I get by, and I didn&#8217;t expect HomePod to make any of these challenges disappear.
</ul>
<p>What I didn&#8217;t expect was how <em>incredibly sensitive</em> Siri on the HomePod would be, and how <em>obnoxiously persistent</em> it would be about responding to my requests, no matter how far I am from the device, nor how unsuited it is for the task at hand.</p>
<p>My first experience with Siri&#8217;s obtrusiveness came while I was listening to loud music in my living room, being played by the HomePod in the dining room next door. I sat on the couch with my laptop, and paused to give myself a reminder about something. Let&#8217;s say it was &#8220;Hey Siri, remind me in 30 minutes to start making dinner.&#8221; I raised my Watch, issued the command, and was startled to hear the music suddenly drop to near silence. What&#8217;s going on? A moment later, Siri boomed from the next room:</p>
<p><em>You can turn personal requests on or off in the Home app associated with this HomePod.</em></p>
<p>Holy what! That was unexpected. An incredible demonstration of the perceptiveness of the HomePod, from a distance and over loud music, and a demonstration of the fundamental problem that is slowly driving me to disdain this thing: it will not stay out of my business! Any attempt to &#8220;Hey Siri&#8221; another device is met by a loud interruption by Siri either of the music, or of the silence of the room. It&#8217;s bad enough that it <em>assumes</em> all requests are being made to it, but it&#8217;s even worse that it insists on chiming in <em>even when it isn&#8217;t capable of serving the request.</em> Just to remind <em>everybody</em> that it&#8217;s not configured for personal requests. After several more unexpected activations, I conceded that things were not going well in the common room. I moved HomePod up to my office.</p>
<p>In my office, the HomePod is less useful as a music playback device, because I&#8217;m usually deep in thought on some programming or writing task, and I don&#8217;t do well with music playing in that context. However, at least in my office I could turn on &#8220;personal requests&#8221; and accept that HomePod might be my occasional fine-listening device, as well as a ubiquitous Siri assistant. At least it was worth a shot!</p>
<p>At this point I should mention that while my home office is <em>primarily</em> where I work on my <a href="https://red-sweater.com">independent software business</a>, that I am also a moderately stressed out person who is trying to get a handle on reining in my busy, anxious-feeling brain. To that end, I commit some time in a typical workday to a very casual attempt at mindfulness meditation. I sit down on the floor, take a few deep breaths, close my eyes, and ask my Watch to &#8220;set a timer for six minutes&#8221; so I can unlock some personal decompression before getting on with my day.</p>
<p>You can guess where this is going: the first time I attempted to meditate in my office after moving the HomePod in, I had just settled down to lap up the water from the trough of relaxation when HomePod blares out at a loud volume: &#8220;Counting down from six minutes.&#8221; I value the timer on the Watch in part because it rouses me from my activity at first with a slight tapping and vibration on my wrist, rather than with a loud alarm sound. But as I had already settled down into my relaxation pose, I decided to soldier on, bracing myself for the room-shattering awakening that was soon to come.</p>
<p>At this point I&#8217;m on the verge of disabling &#8220;Hey Siri&#8221; altogether. Which is unfortunate because, to my mind, it&#8217;s still one of the most impressive features of the device. It&#8217;s just incredible to be able to utter music commands like &#8220;set volume to 30%&#8221;, &#8220;pause&#8221;, &#8220;continue&#8221;, &#8220;skip track&#8221;, etc., even at a whisper from across the room. If I disable this feature, I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ll find the merits of the HomePod as an audio speaker compelling enough to weave into my regular music listening habits.</p>
<p>I have filed a bug with Apple (Radar #37572955) requesting that it be less obtrusively interrupting, particularly <em>when it can&#8217;t do what I&#8217;ve asked</em>. Although I have high hopes for improvements to come with future software updates, you never can be sure when Apple will get around to fixing the issues that most vex you. I&#8217;m conflicted to be at once so impressed with the audio, form factor, and <em>general behavior</em> of Siri on the HomePod, while on the other hand having trouble finding a place in my house where it can show off all those features without also driving me and my family to frustration.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> After publishing the above, I received a note on Twitter from Connor asking what version of watchOS I am running:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Out of curiosity, what model is your watch, and what version of watchOS is it running?</p>
<p>&mdash; Connor Graham (@connor_g) <a href="https://twitter.com/connor_g/status/964281593966690305?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 15, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p>  </p>
<p>I realized I didn&#8217;t know, off the top of my head. I figured I was updating my watchOS regularly, but couldn&#8217;t recall when I&#8217;d last done so. I reported that I was running watchOS 4.1, and he suggested that I might see an improvement after updating to 4.2.2. Yikes! I&#8217;d really fallen behind.</p>
<p>After updating to 4.2.2 I went back to my office and ran a few artificial tests. I immediately noticed the difference, as my Watch responded to &#8220;Hey Siri&#8221; requests, and the HomePod remained silent. I was so surprised that I wanted to confirm the HomePod was still listening. I lowered my Watch and issued a request, which was answered by HomePod. Moments later, I raised the Watch again and tried to address it, and <em>this time</em> the HomePod butted in again.</p>
<p>I think they&#8217;ve made dramatic improvements <em>specifically to watchOS</em> between 4.1 and 4.2.2, but there is still room for improvement. I had run into the problems with HomePod with my iPhone as well, which I confirmed is running the latest version of iOS. Still, the dramatic improvement with the Watch gives me hope that things will continue to improve, and the situation is not quite so dire as I had first experienced it.</p>

<p>Today I had it in mind to write about my belief that Apple should get rid of Xcode Playgrounds and instead focus on adapting the iOS Swift Playgrounds app to the Mac.</p>
<p>I thought at first I would post it here because it&#8217;s not strictly about programming, but I ended up posting it there instead:</p>

    <p>Jeffrey Dastin and Jessica Toonkel, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-films-exclusive/exclusive-amazon-studios-to-cut-back-on-indie-films-in-programming-shift-sources-idUSKBN1F70IG">reporting for Reuters</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Amazon expects to go after films with budgets in the $50 million range at the expense of indie projects costing around $5 million, one person familiar with the plans said on the condition of anonymity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Already this news is garnering some <a href="https://twitter.com/jasondashbailey/status/954030305488326657">jeers</a>, but I welcome it. I hope Amazon doesn’t totally get out of the $5 million and under film game, but projects in that budget range are pretty well served today.</p>

<p>The $50 million film, on the other hand, is the diciest bet in the business. Audiences keep proving that the more you spend on a film, the more likely you are to see a healthy return. This is why there are so many tentpoles with budgets in the stratosphere. In fact, of the top ten highest grossing films<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> of 2017, only one came in at or under the $50 million mark: Andy Muschietti’s adaptation of <em>It</em>, with an estimated budget of $35 million. The expensive films tend to be a sure thing.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Amazon has proven itself an adept and energetic studio. I particularly like that they haven’t cynically written off theatrical runs for their projects (ahem, Netflix). Studios don’t really takes risks in this budget range. Steven Spielberg’s <em>The Post</em> cost an estimated $50 million to make, for example, but a Tom Hanks, Meryl Streep film with one of the most successful filmmakers of all time at the helm isn’t exactly a risk.</p>

<p>Amazon can afford to take the chance on the bigger films we aren’t seeing. I’m excited to see what filmmakers can do with larger budgets on projects that won’t sink a studio if they fail.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Deadline <a href="http://deadline.com/2018/01/amazon-studios-jason-ropell-not-abandoning-indie-film-space-sundance-1202248111/">got a statement from Jason Ropell at Amazon</a>, confirming the part of this I like and denying the part I don’t.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Said Ropell, who is en route to Sundance, for the purpose of watching and possibly buying films here:  “We are not abandoning the indie space, we are increasing the potential size of the audience for our films; that in some cases involves higher budgets, but in others not. It’s about the potential for the film not the cost.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Will definitely be interesting to see what comes out of this new push.</p>

    <p>For the first time in forever I visited the <a href="https://pinboard.in/popular/">popular links</a> page over on <a href="http://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a>, where the site’s most bookmarked URLs are displayed for public perusal. A few dozen users bubbled a recent Tim Bray article, <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2018/01/15/Google-is-losing-its-memory">“Google Memory Loss,”</a> up near the top and it hit a soft spot in me. Here’s the thesis:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think Google has stopped indexing the older parts of the Web.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bray goes on to prove it and offer alternatives, namely <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a> (my preferred search engine) and <a href="https://www.bing.com">Bing</a>. Anecdotally, this comports with my own experience online and reminded me of a defunct little project I’ve been thinking about lately.</p>

<p>For three brief installments in 2013, I had a look-back column here called <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2013/08/28/introducing-hindsight/">Hindsight</a>. The idea was to read year-old stories  and find at least one article on the web at least a decade old. It was an attempt to step away from the daily firehose of current events (already a problem back then; today, a national crisis) and learn something new. Far and away, the most interesting part of this short-lived exercise was finding really old stuff on the web.</p>

<p>I had a few little tricks to discover aging content back then, including using Google’s date range search tool. Trying to use the same tool again this week brings up precious few useful results. From the outside looking in, it feels as though Google is discarding the early web. Which is strange given the company’s supposed raison d’être of organizing the world’s content.</p>

<p>But all is not lost! In search of what was happening this week on the web ten years ago, I started visiting older blogs whose owners have been responsible stewards of their archive. First up was <a href="https://kottke.org/" title="kottke.org  ♥    home of fine hypertext products">Kottke.org</a>. Imagine my surprise when I saw that Jason had taken the <a href="https://kottke.org/08/01/this-week-on-kottkeorg-choire-sicha">third week of January 2008 off</a> and handed the site over to…Awl co-founder Choire Sicha! The Awl <a href="https://www.theawl.com/2018/01/awl-ends/">shuttered yesterday</a>, as did sister site <a href="https://www.thehairpin.com/2018/01/a-note-about-the-hairpin/">The Hairpin</a>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> It’s a blow to independent publishing, but also a straight-up bummer to anyone who’s been reading online for more than a few years. We’ve already had to live <a href="https://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/322408/hulk-hogan-doc-sxsw-nobody-speak/">without a Gawker</a>, now this?</p>

<p>Oh, back to ten years ago this week.</p>

<p>Sicha spent the better part of January 17, 2008, sharing stories of New York City during the early 1990s, apparently <a href="https://kottke.org/08/01/junkies-are-roaming-the-streets-uprooting-flower-beds">research for something</a> I haven’t quite been able to figure out. The <a href="https://kottke.org/08/01/the-early-90s-new-york-city-real-estate-slump" title="The Early ’90s New York City Real Estate Slump">wildest, I think</a>, was a <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE1DB1531F93AA1575AC0A967958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all" title="New York Times, September 29, 1991">1991 <em>New York Times</em> article</a> on East Village apartment owners desperately trying to sell their abodes (in one case to the tune of a $100,000 loss) with no takers.</p>

<p>The topics bob and weave all over the map throughout the week. There are two posts that <a href="https://kottke.org/08/01/saw-a-screening-of-cloverfield-last-night" title="Saw a screening of “Cloverfield” last night.">ponder</a> whether it was <a href="https://kottke.org/08/01/my-moviegoing-pal-sara-vilkomerson-agrees-about" title="My movie-going pal Sara Vilkomerson agrees about">too soon</a> for <em>Cloverfield</em> after 9/11 (and a third that considers the same topic <a href="https://kottke.org/08/01/too-soonnot-too-soon" title="Too Soon/Not Too Soon">as it relates to a Laurie Anderson live album</a>). He <a href="https://kottke.org/08/01/the-jobsnote-is-going-on-right-now" title="The JobsNote is going on right now&amp;">alerts readers</a> to Apple’s introduction of iTunes movie rentals and complains about the lack of copy-paste on iPhone.</p>

<p>In a strange confluence of my own recent interests, <a href="https://kottke.org/08/01/jake-shears-of-the-scissor-sisters-is" title="“Jake Shears” of the Scissor Sisters is">Sicha points to</a> news of work on a <a href="https://ephemerist.wordpress.com/2008/01/18/it-cant-come-quickly-enough/">musical version of Armistead Maupin’s <em>Tales of the City</em></a>. I had never heard of Maupin until a few weeks ago, when <a href="http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/films/untold-tales-armistead-maupin/">PBS aired <em>The Untold Tales of Armistead Maupin</em></a> (still waiting for me in my DVR queue) and I grabbed the first volume of <em>Tales</em> from the library. (I’ve started out my year with an interest in serialized fiction.) Anyway, the musical ended up premiering in 2011, called by <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/performance/article/Armistead-Maupin-s-Tales-of-the-City-review-2369831.php">SFGate theater critic Robert Hurwitt</a> “a blithe, comic and pleasantly tuneful celebration of sex, drugs and all kinds of coming out in freewheeling, pre-AIDS San Francisco circa 1976.”</p>

<p>The web has changed dramatically in the decade since Sicha’s week on Kottke.org. It’s a blogging style (furious, scattershot, immediate) the modern reader may not even recognize. And if Google really has stopped indexing the older bits of the web, it’s a style the future reader may not have the chance to consider.</p>

<p>I guess it’s incumbent upon the rest of us to keep that corpus relevant. The <a href="https://archive.org">Internet Archive</a> does the hard work of preserving the web as it was<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and, as Bray mentioned in his article, other search engines are doing much better than Google. But an archive is nothing if it’s not gone through every once in awhile, just as an unused library serves merely as a warehouse.</p>

<p>I know I learned a great deal from looking at just one site as it was a decade ago. I’m curious to hear if others find this interesting as well. As I mentioned above, I’ve been thinking about the <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/blog/categories/hindsight/">Hindsight column</a> that I never really pursued. If I started it again today, I would probably focus only on stories published at least ten years ago. I’d like to be a bit more deliberate about it this time around, and it would help to hear if people would want to read something like this regularly. Would you want to read it here? A new site? In the oh-so-of-the-moment newsletter form? Let me know what you think in the comments or <a href="https://twitter.com/poritsky">on twitter</a> or <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/contact/">drop me a line</a>. Or just come back again soon to see where this goes.</p>

    <p>This <a href="https://www.avclub.com/streaming-services-are-butchering-aspect-ratios-1822087395">A.V. Club story</a> on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xy6kHQsErE">Patrick (H) Willems YouTube video</a> about aspect ratios scratches at an itch I’ve been having lately: why on earth does HBO in particular crop most films to 16:9?</p>

<p>I think Willems goes a bit too far in his video, starting with the title, “HBO is Ruining Movies.” Cinema tends to be more than the sum of its parts, so if someone watches a film in a different aspect ratio than it was shot for, they still watched the movie. Stories are able to break through whatever impediments get thrown in their way. So HBO isn’t ruining, say, the Harry Potter franchise by cropping the sides of the film off, but it certainly isn’t offering up the ideal viewing experience either.</p>

<p>A great, concise explanation of how cropping can change a film comes by way of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQXqrL8AEVw">1990 “At the Movies” discussion between Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel</a> (uploaded and brought to light again by <a href="https://twitter.com/tvaziri/status/952949285800181761" title="Jan 15">Todd Vaziri</a>). They use the example of <em>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</em>, projected originally at 2.39:1, being re-edited to fit on 4:3 home video screens. It’s a damning breakdown of how a director’s vision being muddied by studios out to move some VHS tapes.</p>

<p>In the era of 4:3 screens I can see why studios made the call to release films cropped. Most homes didn’t have a very large set, and the resolution was so low to begin with, most viewers would be upset to see their film scaled down at all.</p>

<p>But those days are gone. Not only are almost all TV sets now 16:9, but they’re pretty darn big too. Even cropping all the way down to 2.39:1 would still leave a pretty huge image side-to-side.</p>

<p>So why does HBO persist in cropping? Maybe people want every pixel of their widescreen TVs filled up or they feel they’re not getting their money’s worth? Does HBO have research/polling on this? Or maybe studios deliberately offer up the cropped versions to cable streamers so they can milk extra bucks off rentals and purchases. You want the full picture? Pay up.</p>

<p>Why not solve this by offering both options on streaming services? Why not build a setting in that says you always prefer a full, widescreen picture at the original aspect ratio? On a phone you can easily zoom an image to fill the screen if you prefer not to see any letter-/pillar-boxing. Shouldn’t this be available on TV sets as well?</p>

<p>Willems mentions in his video that anytime he goes to watch a film, he first visits the “Technical Specs” heading on IMDb to check if the version he’s watching is in the correct aspect. If it’s not, he’ll stop watching. I used to do this, but I’ve loosened up. I recommend others do, too.</p>

<p>I grew up in the VHS era. The only time I ever saw letterboxing on films was if my father stopped at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLA_Entertainment_Group">TLA Video</a> (sadly, now defunct) in center city Philadelphia for a hard to find film. Almost every film I watched at home was cropped. And yet, my love of movies persists. I can still remember wearing out 4:3 cropped tapes of widescreen films, memorizing lines and falling in love with the story all over again. At this point, it’s silly that HBO and others are putting up cropped versions of films, but I’d rather watch something than nothing at all.</p>

    <p>I had an idea for a story in college. Terrorists blow up the Academy Awards, killing off a generation of filmmakers. (The “In Memoriam” the following year would be three hours long, I so brilliantly quipped.) Our story picks up in the aftermath, following the son of a famous filmmaker who is asked to helm a large project in hopes of getting the movie business back on track. In my view, this could be a comedy, but I couldn’t figure out how to keep things light knowing that the deaths of a few hundred or thousand people move our plot forward, so it went abandoned.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Recently, though, I’ve been thinking about this story a great deal. Harvey Weinstein was the bomb that went off inside Hollywood. His transgressions and crimes have touched the entire industry. I’m no scholar of Hollywood history but this moment feels like nothing that has ever touched the industry.</p>

<p>The story I wrote in college, however morbid, was about making a space in the business for the voice of a young filmmaker. The Weinstein revelations are making that space. The movies are being forced to change, to infuse new voices. The show, inevitably, goes on. There is no easy fix for decades of harassment and abuse. There is no telling on how much work we’ve been deprived of because those with the pursestrings were preoccupied with abusive behavior. Hopefully we will finally get more original stories from the far flung corners of our own creative communities.</p>

<p>Every year we hope that Hollywood will recognize that it needn’t look far to find that infusion of talent from long held back communities. With all corners of the business running from scandal and the receipts<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> to prove audiences want to hear from new voices, perhaps this is the time for real change. I can’t wait to see what comes next.</p>

<p>With that, here are my favorite films of 2017. I saw far too few new releases this year for this to be comprehensive to any degree. Last year I set a goal for myself to watch 50 new releases. I fell short, clocking in at only 29 and some of those are murky thanks to the strange ways films are released these days. As an example, that number includes Joe Swanberg’s <em>Win it All</em>, a film I saw in a crowded theater at SXSW but went straight to Netflix without a theatrical run. That number also includes Errol Morris’ <em>Wormwood</em>, a television series released in New York as a four hour film. I don’t quite understand how to parse that out, but since I have always gone by <a href="http://www.panix.com/~dangelo/nymaster.html">Mike D’Angelo’s invaluable NYC release list</a> (which now includes streaming only lists), I’ll just include them in my year end consideration.</p>

<p>Enough chit-chat. Onto the movies.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.candlerblog.com/images/2017/12/person-to-person-still.jpg" title="Bene Coopersmith in Person to Person" /></p>

<h3 id="person-to-person">Person to Person</h3>

<p>As a fan of director Dustin Guy Defa’s 2011 debut, <em>Bad Fever</em>, my expectations were relatively high for the filmmaker’s second feature, the delightful <em>Person to Person</em>. As I said in <a href="https://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/321982/person-to-person-is-a-sprawling-collage-of-life-in-new-york-but-in-a-good-way/">my review</a>, Defa’s New York City collage “approaches the scope of Robert Altman and the depth of Todd Solondz.” It features some of the best performances I’ve seen this year, with the standout being Bene Coopersmith as a record collector getting close to a big score. My love for this movie was instant, and I’m sure it will stick with me for years to come.</p>

<h3 id="lady-bird">Lady Bird</h3>

<p>Anyone who has ever seen a Greta Gerwig performance knows that the heart of a writer-director beats within her. On screen she exudes an energy that almost shimmers; there is no ounce of her that isn’t committed the story she occupies. It is no surprise, then, that her debut directorial effort, <em>Lady Bird</em>, is one of the year’s great films.</p>

<p>And yet <em>Lady Bird</em> is a film that surprises nonetheless. Saoirse Ronan possesses a similar luminance to a Gerwig portrayal, controlling the screen wherever she goes while remaining aloof to the power she holds over the screen, its inhabitants and its audience. That this story is one of a woman coming to grips with the force of her own being requires such a presence. Ronan’s foil, Laurie Metcalf, wrecked me as Lady Bird’s mother, a woman discovering the exact opposite: that her power has waned enough that the she must learn to let go. Smart and affecting, funny and beautifully filmed, I hope this is a mere beginning to Gerwig’s directing days. Of course, selfishly, I hope it doesn’t keep her from stepping in front of the camera as well.</p>

<h3 id="columbus">Columbus</h3>

<p>The form of the video essay has long both attracted and repelled me. My fear with any essay is that it provides a mere surface understanding of a film, a textual analysis devoid of whatever spark of life exists between the frames. The essays by kogonada have always allayed those fears. Instead of playing mortician, his have always breathed new life into the films he picks apart. Working with the films of others, it was clear he had a voice all his own and plenty to say. <em>Columbus</em>, kogonada’s first feature, is a lush coming of age tale that hews closely to the style of <a href="https://creators.vice.com/en_us/article/pgz4xg/supercut-film-school-qa-with-elusive-anonymous-video-essayist-kogonada">his favorite director</a>, Yasujirō Ozu. Yet just as kogonada’s essays bring out his voice among the pieces of others, this film is much more than a surface-level homage.</p>

<p>I have seen precious little Ozu, but kogonada seems to have struck upon a rather useful confluence: that American independent cinema of the last decade and a half or so share a great deal with Ozu’s most well known stories. Namely they are tales of family life told simply but unsparingly, plumbing the emotional depths of their characters while, crucially, allowing that one’s surroundings are an extension of themselves. <em>Columbus</em> is a film about modernist architecture, but it is also about what modernism has wrought.</p>

<p>Haley Lu Richardson provides the standout performance here as Casey, a young woman who is skipping college to work in a library and help keep her mother sober. The role feels impossible. She is often in total control but wants to break free of herself. She skipped over teenage angst but longs for it. The performance, and the film itself, at times feels disjointed, which is part of what draws me in further. The film sometimes becomes too clean, too perfect and manicured like the landscaping amid the primly kept buildings; it is when it flails around for its footing that it becomes something more.</p>

<h3 id="wonder-woman">Wonder Woman</h3>

<p>Most of my favorite films this year come from the indie arthouse world. I do not know if <em>Wonder Woman</em> would make the cut were it not for the voluminous baggage that comes with being a DC Comics film. Almost everything I like about this film must be put in context, and I’m not sure if I will still like it in five years or even next year. But for now: it floored me.</p>

<p>I can boil it down to one word: empathy. I can’t recall an empathetic superhero film since, probably, Richard Donner’s <em>Superman: The Movie</em>. The paradigm lately has been that of the sympathetic hero (if at all). The difference is simple: we feel for the sympathetic hero while the empathetic hero feels for, well, if not us than for <em>something</em>.</p>

<p><em>Wonder Woman’s</em> centerpiece moment in “No Man’s Land” works not (just) because of the music and the reveal of Diana’s costume and the significant buildup to seeing something extraordinary; it works because our hero has the revelation that people are in trouble and she can do something about it. It is a selfless, heroic act committed in a world of cynics. This empathy oozes off the screen and it is a delight to watch.</p>

<h3 id="the-big-sick">The Big Sick</h3>

<p>There are laughs in <em>The Big Sick</em> that come from places I can barely understand. Even when there is nothing funny happening, the laughs keep coming. I only watched it once and it had me laughing through tears. I’ll need to revisit again soon and write proper thoughts about the way it affects me.</p>

<h3 id="porto">Porto</h3>

<p>It was my great pleasure to see a 35mm print of Gabe Klinger’s <em>Porto</em> at SXSW. It is a beautiful little novella of a film, and an unintentional elegy for its star, Anton Yelchin. He plays Jake, a loner wandering the streets of Porto, Portugal who meets Mati, played by Lucie Lucas. Revisiting my notes, I scribbled that Jake almost feels like Travis Bickle; Yelchin delivers a performance on that same level.</p>

<p><em>Porto’s</em> run time is short, a mere 76 minutes, but it is a deep meditation on the concepts of lust and love. Its narrative is expertly crafted, and it makes the pain of losing Yelchin feel all the worse. Seek it out.</p>

<h3 id="suntan">Suntan</h3>

<p>I was very happy to see Argyris Papadimitropoulos’ <em>Suntan</em> get a US release this year. It’s of a genre I call “fucked up Greek stuff” along the lines of Yorgos Lanthimos’ work, though on a much more accessible end of the spectrum. The film follows Kostis, a doctor with a dark past who moves to a beach town. He becomes something of an aged mascot to a youthful group, but he thinks much more of the relationships he has forged than his counterparts.</p>

<p>What I loved about watching this film is I never knew where it was going to take me. There is a sense of violence beneath the surface of every scene, but you are strung along always wondering what will come next. The mysteriousness does not feel like a gimmick; more like a sort of raw power that pumps the story forward. By the end you will rethink what you have been feeling throughout.</p>

<h3 id="the-rest">The Rest</h3>

<p><em>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</em> was enjoyable enough. I will remember it mostly for the bunk coverage of fan vs. critic reactions. Can we please once and for all never have another story based around Rotten Tomatoes or Metacritic or whatever else scores? Another highlight along this storyline: <a href="https://deadline.com/2017/05/pirates-of-the-caribbean-5-dead-men-tell-no-tales-baywatch-box-office-weekend-1202102887/">the Tomatometer killed <em>Baywatch</em> or something</a>.</p>

<p>I loved <em>Get Out</em>, which may well be one of the most written about films of the year. I can’t add much to the chorus, but I will say this: it’s been a delight to see both Jordan Peele and Keegan Michael Key break into movies since the end of their Comedy Central show. Key’s acting is always a wonderful addition to anything he’s been in, particularly <em>Don’t Think Twice</em>. And Peele has turned out to be the voice of a new generation of filmmakers. I’m very glad he’s not sticking to fare more akin to <em>Keanu</em>, which he co-wrote.</p>

<p>James Franco’s <em>The Disaster Artist</em> is a fun backstage comedy. I wrote about it <a href="https://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/322178/james-franco-the-room-disaster-artist-sxsw/">back in March</a>. One thing I forgot to mention is the cameo by Judd Apatow, who plays against type as a believable asshole. Acting!</p>

<p><em>mother!</em> is insane and nowhere near as smart as it believes itself to be, but worthwhile viewing nonetheless. It’s the sort of film that belongs, perhaps, on a midnight movie circuit. If you can stomach it, it makes great conversation fodder. I wouldn’t be surprised if I revisit it in years to come and have completely new and different feelings about it. A surprise was Kristen Wiig’s role, which manages to eek out a bit of levity amid unrelenting cacophony.</p>

<p>A few negative thoughts: I did not understand the love affair everyone else seemed to have with <em>Baby Driver</em>. The opening car chase was thrilling and then nothing after approached its inventiveness. Narratively everything starts to fall apart towards the end when our bad guy turns out to be the wrong person. (And an adversary suddenly flips for no reason?) It didn’t do much for me.</p>

<p>I am not a huge fan of Christopher Nolan to begin with, but <em>Dunkirk</em> feels sterile and stunted. In trying to tell three stories well it feels as though we don’t even have a full thread to follow. Though the photography is impressive, it doesn’t all come together for me like the Swiss watch the film’s score would have you believe you it is. For my money, the tale of Mark Rylance at sea should have been the whole film.</p>

<p><em>Blade Runner 2049</em> felt like two movies, one of which I really enjoyed! The other, not so much. The photography is, naturally, stellar. Roger Deakins deserves all the awards, but perhaps he’ll get skipped over as is the annual tradition.</p>

<p>I think that covers just about everything I have to say about the movies this year. Next year will bring a new set of stories and, hopefully, a new class of storytellers. I’m looking forward to see what the future holds.</p>

    <p>Manton and I just published the second episode of our members-only Extra Intuition podcast: <a href="https://coreint.org/2017/10/extra-intuition-2-i-know-it-was-15-years-ago/">I Know it was 15 Years Ago</a>. We&#8217;re joined by Gus Mueller of <a href="https://flyingmeat.com">Flying Meat</a> to chat about &#8230; whatever comes up! Many thanks to Gus for taking the time to do the show.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fun to have a chance to deviate from the usual format of <a href="https://coreint.org">Core Intuition</a>. In some ways it&#8217;s more relaxed, like the show was in the early days. We are looking forward to mixing it up with interviews and other conversations that we don&#8217;t think are as suitable to the main show. </p>
<p>Our first episode, <a href="https://coreint.org/2017/10/extra-intuition-1-we-did-meet-in-person/">We Did Meet in Person</a> features our recollections of meeting each other and starting to podcast together.</p>

    <p>Today <a href="http://www.manton.org/2017/10/extra-intuition.html">Manton</a> and I released the <a href="http://coreint.org/300">300th episode of Core Intuition</a>. We published the first episode on May 30, 2008, and every episode since has been completely free for our listeners. Starting with Episode 301, that&#8217;s &#8230; going to stay completely the same. Except&#8230;</p>
<p>Core Intuition is now offering a <a href="https://coreint.org/membership/">membership program</a>. We have been lucky over the past several years to have the financial support of many great sponsors, but we also want our enthusiastic listeners to have the option of supporting us directly. In the long term, we don&#8217;t know if we can count on our sponsorship luck to continue indefinitely, and would like to be able to continue doing the show regardless of how those fortunes shift.</p>
<p>We think that many of our listeners would support us without an incentive, but what&#8217;s the fun in that? That&#8217;s why we decided to start a <em>second podcast</em>, exclusively for members. <strong>Extra Intuition</strong> will feature extra discussions, interviews, and frankly, we&#8217;re not sure what. We&#8217;re just excited to have an outlet for some of the stuff we want to talk about, but doesn&#8217;t exactly fit the format of the main show.</p>
<p>Our first episode of Extra Intuition is already live, and it features a discussion about the early days of our friendship, and how we decided to start Core Intuition. If that sounds intriguing, please consider <a href="https://coreint.org/membership/">becoming a member</a> so you can check out the show!</p>

    <p>Apple&#8217;s sandboxing technology provides a mechanism for developers to specify &#8220;entitlements&#8221; that an app needs in order to provide functionality that users want. For example, on the Mac, an app can specify the entitlements to &#8220;print&#8221; and to &#8220;make network requests.&#8221; This system of granular privilege designation is a great baseline both for developers, to avoid accidentally overstepping intended bounds, and for users, to protect against apps intentionally or accidentally causing harm.</p>
<p>One of the biggest problems with Apple&#8217;s approach to sandboxing is that the accountability component has been left entirely to Apple itself. Developers are held accountable for the specific entitlements they request only when they distribute software through the iOS or Mac App Stores. In the review process, Apple may determine that a specific entitlement requested from an app is inappropriate for that app&#8217;s domain, and demand that the developer remove the entitlement before being approved. Or, in rare cases, they may approve an entitlement that other developers are not typically granted.</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/researchers-uber-s-ios-app-had-secret-permissions-that-1819177235">Gizmodo reported</a> that Uber had been granted an entitlement for their iOS app that allowed them to capture an image of an iPhone&#8217;s screen at any time, even when the Uber app was not the active app on the phone. This is a big deal, because users <em>don&#8217;t typically expect</em> than an iPhone app that is not active might have the ability to eavesdrop on anything they are doing.</p>
<p>I have long felt that the sandboxing infrastructure on both iOS and Mac should be used to more accurately convey to users specifically what the apps they install are capable of doing. Currently the sandboxing system is used primarily to identify <em>to Apple</em> what a specific app&#8217;s privileges are. The requested entitlements are used to inform Apple&#8217;s decision to approve or reject an app, but the specific list of entitlements is not easily available to users, whose security is actually on the line.</p>
<p>I think the next step for sandboxing, on both iOS and the Mac, is to expose the list of entitlements that apps possess, in a way that is reasonably understandable to all users, and even more open to scrutiny by power users. Any user who is wary of an app should be able to examine its entitlements so that any unusual privileges can be evaluated. With this level of transparency, you can bet that Uber&#8217;s ability to arbitrarily record the screen would have been revealed much earlier.</p>
<p>Being more transparent with entitlements would also pave the way for overcoming an unfortunate side-effect of sandboxing: the elimination of whole classes of power-user level apps. If users were empowered to know what the privileges of an app are, through a combination of user prompting and an interface for inspecting entitlements, then it would be reasonable to grant more indulgent entitlements to developers.</p>
<p>Mac apps such as <a href="https://textexpander.com">TextExpander</a> essentially became unqualified for the Mac App Store with the advent of sandboxing, because they require access to system services such as monitoring the user&#8217;s keyboard input, in order to provide valuable macro text substitution. If entitlements were transparent across the board, and users were consistently informed about the extent of an application&#8217;s capabilities, it would empower users to make more reasonable decisions about the software they run. It would empower them to allow apps like TextExpander that are currently disallowed by the App Store&#8217;s sandboxing policies, and to reject apps like Uber that may be unexpectedly allowed to capture footage of users&#8217; activity even while running other apps.</p>

    <p>Today, <a href="https://twitter.com/khanlou">Soroush Khanlou</a> and I are launching a new app named <a href="https://ashleynh.github.io/beacon-site/">Beacon</a>, that we’re hoping everyone in San Jose for WWDC will find invaluable. Beacon allows you to signal availability to your friends, people you follow on Twitter that also follow you back. We wanted to create a place for ad-hoc events to flourish. A space where anyone could say they're free now, headed to a session, or getting lunch – and make these events available for their friends to join. We also wanted to encourage extending beyond friend groups, so Beacon allows for creating and viewing public events in your area. Five weeks ago we decided to work on this idea, and I’m incredibly proud of the work we accomplished in such a short amount of time. Of course the app is written in Swift – Swift 3 to be exact – but the server <a href="http://khanlou.com/2017/06/beacon/">is written in Swift</a> too!</p>

<p>Beacon is an idea that's been in my head for a while, positioned to be specific for WWDC. We're treating this as an experiment to see if people find it as useful as we hope.</p>

<p>I want to thank everyone who beta tested the app with us and our partners for bearing with us while we spent long nights and weekends getting our app out the door. Special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/lindadong">Linda Dong</a> for her generous design contribution, and help positioning Beacon as a colorful and exciting place to connect with friends in the real world.</p>

    <p>
Like many other professional Mac users, I suspect, I was <a href="https://twitter.com/betalogue/status/849244244481126400">quite relieved</a> when Apple finally shared, in early April, with a select panel of writers who cover Apple news, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2017/04/the_mac_pro_lives">their plans for the Mac Pro</a> and, more generally speaking, for pro and “prosumer” users of Macintosh computers.
</p>
<p>
When the new Mac Pro was announced in 2013, I was still using a workstation consisting of a 2009 Mac Pro with 12 GB of RAM, two SuperDrives (one for Region 1 and one for Region 2), and two GeForce GT 120 video cards driving two 30&#8243; Apple Cinema Displays (each with a native resolution of 2,560 x 1,600 pixels). I had, in previous years, changed my startup drive from the conventional 1 TB hard drive that came with the Mac Pro to a 240GB Mercury EXTREME Pro 6G SSD from <a href="https://eshop.macsales.com/item/OWC/SSD7P6G240/">Other World Computing</a>, and I had three conventional hard drives in the other three internal bays, as well as some external FireWire hard drives for backup.
</p>
<p>
I was reasonably happy with the 2009 Mac Pro, but of course, by that time it was getting a bit long in the tooth and I started lusting after the new Mac Pro. What I found particularly attractive was its promise of near-silent operation. While the 2009 Mac Pro was not outrageously noisy, it still was far from silent. Now, I knew, of course, that, with no internal bays for hard drives, even if I got a large internal SSD for the 2013 Mac Pro, I would still need external drives, and those could be quite noisy. But I also knew that Thunderbolt offered the possibility of a very long cable connection between the drives and the computer, which meant that I had the option to relegate the hard drives to a more remote location.
</p>
<p>
Because of past experience with problematic devices (the original Titanium PowerBook G4 with its very poor AirPort reception, and the disastrous <a href="https://www.betalogue.com/2006/06/04/macbook-the-mooing-noise-disaster/">mooing MacBook</a>), there was no way that I was going to be an early adopter of the 2013 Mac Pro, so I waited until well into 2014 before purchasing one.
</p>
<p>
In July 2014, I bought a new Mac Pro with 32 GB of RAM, a 1-TB SSD internal drive, along with a 32&#8243; 4K Sharp PN-K321 display (3,840 x 2,160 pixels), a <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/shop/product/MB570LL/B/mini-displayport-to-dvi-adapter">miniDisplayPort-to-DVI adapter</a> for one of my 30&#8243; Apple Cinema Displays, and an external <a href="https://www.promise.com/Products/Pegasus/Pegasus2">Promise Pegasus2 R4</a> Thunderbolt 2 unit with four 2 GB conventional hard drives, with a 30-foot Thunderbolt 2 cable to connect the Pegasus2 R4 to the Mac Pro. (It was an expensive order.)
</p>
<p>
When we moved to our new house in December 2014, I was able to move the Pegasus2 R4 to the basement, which meant that I now only had the Mac Pro and the displays on my desk in my office. It was close to perfectly silent operation most of the time. (Occasionally, when it gets quite warm in the room, the Mac Pro fan does kick in a bit, with a somewhat annoying high-pitched whine, but it’s fairly rare, and nowhere near as annoying as the constant whir of the fans in conventional hard drives.)
</p>
<p>
At first, it didn’t really bother me or worry me that Apple didn’t release upgraded versions of the 2013 Mac Pro. I was happy with my machine, and the lack of upgrades meant that I didn’t even have to worry about being tempted by a new Mac. But then, of course, after a couple of years, the complete lack of upgrades caused me to start worrying, like many others, about the long-term future of the Mac Pro and about the future of the Mac platform in general. (My dismal experiences with OS X on the Mac Pro, especially with <a href="https://www.betalogue.com/2015/04/15/os-x-10-10-3-responsiveness-issues/">Yosemite</a>, did little to help dispell my concerns.)
</p>
<p>
Then I had another bad experience with OS X, this time with El Capitan and the random temporary video freezes it would cause on my Mac Pro. As <a href="https://www.betalogue.com/2017/01/21/video-freezes-software-after-all/">reported earlier on this blog</a>, the problem was initially misdiagnosed by Apple as a hardware problem, which forced me to leave the Mac Pro at the Apple store for about 10 days back in December 2016. This unfortunate situation indirectly led me to make the somewhat impulsive decision to purchase a new iMac 5K. The idea was that I would use it as a replacement for the Mac Pro for 10 days, and then, when I got my Mac Pro back (presumably fixed), I would give the iMac 5K to my wife to replace her own desktop machine, which was my older 2009 Mac Pro. (Performance-wise, the older Mac Pro was more than enough for her, but of course, she too dreamed of a quieter machine, and the 2009 Mac Pro was now seven years old…)
</p>
<p>
My idea was that not only it was time to get a new Mac for my wife anyway, but also that I would get to test-drive the iMac 5K as a workstation for my own office for 10 days. At that stage, in December 2016, there was still complete radio silence from Apple about the future of the Mac Pro, and even about the Mac more generally speaking. I figured that, if indeed they were to abandon the Mac Pro altogether, I might have to fall back on a beefed-up iMac as an alternative, and I wanted to see if it was feasible.
</p>
<p>
My conclusion after 10 days was that it was indeed feasible. It would not be ideal, because the performance level on the iMac 5K with a 2 TB Fusion drive was not quite on par with the 2014 Mac Pro, but it was not too slow, and I would always have the option to get an iMac with an SSD drive instead of a Fusion drive.
</p>
<p>
I must admit that I was also curious to see what it would feel like to work with a Retina monitor for the first time. I had first-hand experience with Retina on the iPad and on the iPhone, but not on a desktop computer. (I had never owned a Retina laptop either.) My view had always been that it was more important for me to have lots of screen real estate than to have a very high resolution.
</p>
<p>
I was able to set up the iMac 5K with my 4K Sharp PN-K321 monitor as a secondary display, and thus get a display setup that was somewhat similar to what I was used to on the Mac Pro (with the Sharp PN-K321 display as my main display and a 30&#8243; Apple Cinema Display as a secondary display) — except with a better-quality picture all around.
</p>
<p>
Then I got my Mac Pro back (with a replacement video card that did nothing to fix the random video freezes — which turned out to be fixed by upgrading to Sierra later in December), I had to give up the iMac 5K. I didn’t really miss it, except… that I had been bitten by the Retina bug. There was just no denying that things looked much better in macOS with Retina, and so I started experimenting with my existing setup on the Mac Pro and exploring my options.
</p>
<p>
The first that I did was that I tried using the Sharp PN-K321 display in “scaled” resolution, i.e. in Retina mode. That meant sacrificing quite a bit of screen real estate, because I was now down to an effective resolution of 1,920 x 1,080 pixels (as opposed to the native 3,840 x 2,160 pixels), but I also had to admit that, even with the native 3,840 x 2,160 resolution, I was only able to have two document windows open side by side, with a high zoom setting (around 200%, to make the text readable at a comfortable level). Now I could still have two documents side by side, with a more normal zoom setting (a little over 100%), but the text looked undeniably better.
</p>
<p>
The one major drawback in this approach was that, since the Sharp PN-K321 monitor was my primary display, the whole macOS user interface was now much bigger and taking more space. I could use some settings in macOS itself or in third-party tools for tinkering with hidden macOS settings to try and minimize the impact of the switch, but there were still things that I could do nothing about. The menubar itself, for example, was now pretty big, with much less room for menu extras on the right. (I was already a <a href="https://www.macbartender.com/">Bartender</a> user, but I had to move more items to the secondary bar.) Also, all the controls in individual applications were bigger. For certain things, it was not too much of a problem. Dialog boxes might have been larger, for example, but they didn’t have to stay open all the time. For other things, which had to stay open and visible all the time, it was more of a problem. The Word 2016 user interface and its “Ribbon” for example, now had much less space available to display controls, so that fewer controls were visible at any given time, and some only in compact form, as opposed to the more expansive form that I was used to. Similary, I had to reorganize my <a href="https://www.dragthing.com/">DragThing</a> docks, my <a href="https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/">BBEdit</a> palettes, my Adobe InDesign palettes, and so on.
</p>
<p>
Still, I was willing to live like that for a while, with the Sharp PN-K321 monitor in Retina mode as my main display and with the 30&#8243; Apple Cinema Display at native resolution as a secondary display. (It also helped that I was able to fairly quickly adjust my <a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/">Keyboard Maestro</a> macros for shuffling windows around and resizing them automatically.)
</p>
<p>
My long-term goal, however, was to seriously investigate the possibility of acquiring a 5K display for my Mac Pro. I must say, however, that I was quite disappointed in the lack of results when I tried searching for information about this online.
</p>
<p>
For one thing, Apple’s own documentation on this is lacking. If you check the page titled “<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202801">Use multiple displays with your Mac Pro (Late 2013)</a>”, for instance, it still reads:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can connect up to six of the following properly-configured displays to your Mac Pro (Late 2013).
</p>
<ul>
<li>Six Apple Thunderbolt Displays (27-inch), Apple LED Cinema Displays (27-inch), or third-party Mini DisplayPort displays.</li>
<li>Three 4K displays: two connected via Mini DisplayPort and one connected via HDMI.</li>
<li>One 4K Ultra HD TV or 4K display using HDMI and four Apple Thunderbolt Displays (27-inch), Apple LED Cinema Displays (27-inch), or third-party Mini DisplayPort displays.</li>
<li>Two HDMI (HD or 4K) devices: one connected via HDMI and one connected via Mini DisplayPort with an HDMI adapter.</li>
<li>Six DVI displays. This configuration requires an active DVI adapter. </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
Not a single mention of 5K displays on this page! Granted, 5K displays weren’t even available when the Mac Pro first came out, but they became available soon after, and there were enough mentions of people using a monitor such as the Dell UP2715K with a Mac Pro online to indicate that this was feasible. Of course, when you are talking about hardware products by companies other than Apple, the situation with the documentation is even more abysmal. Even today, if you do a Google search for “<a href="https://www.google.ca/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=BBEdit&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;gfe_rd=cr&amp;ei=7Z0gWYW4JrTs8AeozYzwCQ#safe=off&amp;q=Dell+UP2715K+mac+pro">Dell UP2715K mac pro</a>”, the very first result you get is… a knowledge base article from Dell titled “<a href="http://www.dell.com/support/article/ca/en/cabsdt1/SLN295121/issues-apple-mac-platform-users-may-encounter-using-the-up2715k-dell-ultrasharp-27-ultra-hd-5k-monitor?lang=EN">Issues Apple Mac platform users may encounter using the UP2715k Dell UltraSharp 27 Ultra HD 5K Monitor</a>”. Not an article about how to do it, but an article about the problems you may encounter if you try to do it!
</p>
<p>
To make an already long story not too much longer, after reading all this and other stuff, I decided to take the plunge and order a Dell UP2715K for the Mac Pro. Based on what I had found online, the monitor itself would come with the dual DisplayPort-to-Mini-DisplayPort (DP-to-mDP) cable required to connect the monitor to the Mac Pro.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, when I looked at Dell’s own shop pages, I found that there was a page about the monitor, but it was listed as being discontinued and being replaced with a new product. (This was in January 2017.) But when I clicked on the link to see the new product supposed to replace it, it took me… nowhere. (I can no longer show you all this, because this page for the monitor in Dell’s own online store no longer exists. All that is left on the Dell web site is the <a href="http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/product-support/servicetag/UP2715K/research">support page for the product</a>.)
</p>
<p>
I still found the monitor for sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Monitor-UP2715K-27-Inch-Screen-LED-Lit/dp/B00OKSFXZU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1495310844&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Dell+UP2715K">Amazon.ca</a> and at <a href="https://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824260302CVF&amp;cm_re=UP2715K-_-24-260-302CVF-_-Product">NewEgg.ca</a>. Amazon had several offers for it, including one where the monitor was sold by Amazon itself and a few others where it was sold by third parties through Amazon. Even though the Amazon.ca offer said “<span class="passage">Usually ships within 1 to 2 months</span>”, I was not in a hurry, and I have had nothing but good experiences with purchases from Amazon.ca, so I decided to go for that option. (It was also a bit cheaper than the other offers.)
</p>
<p>
Two months later, however, I got an automatic notice that the shipment was delayed by another month. I still wasn’t in a hurry, so I decided to wait. Once month later, same thing: shipment delayed by another month. At that stage, I decided that there was a good chance that it might never ship, and there were no further news about the “replacement” product from Dell either, so I decided to go with NewEgg.ca. By now, NewEgg had several offers from third parties, including one that had a pretty good price for the monitor (cheaper than the original Amazon offer) and a reasonable fee for shipping. I cancelled the order from Amazon and ordered that one instead.
</p>
<p>
One week later, the Dell UP2715K was delivered by UPS. It had everything in the box that it was supposed to have, including the dual cable that I needed. Of course, I knew that, it being a Dell product, it was probably not going to work without some effort and configuration. And sure enough, when I tried to connect it, nothing happened. I had disconnected the 30&#8243; Apple Cinema Display with the mDP-to-DVI adapter and tried to connect the Dell while the Sharp was still connected, but I didn’t get anything.
</p>
<p>
I tried fiddling with cables, rebooting, etc. to no avail. Then finally I realized that the Dell was probably not smart enough to automatically detect what it was connected to, so I fiddled with the Dell’s own buttons on the side of the screen. Sure enough, even though I had used the two available DisplayPort connections on the monitor, for some reason it was configured to use something else as the “input” by default. (I cannot remember now whether it was HDMI or something else.) Once I told the Dell to use the correct source as input, I finally got something! But then all of a sudden I could no longer get my Sharp PN-K321 monitor to work. I had the 5K monitor as my main display, but the Mac Pro refused to see the 4K Sharp monitor as a secondary display.
</p>
<p>
Then, because of the lack of documentation about this online, I started to worry that maybe the Mac Pro was not able to handle <strong>both</strong> a 5K monitor and a 4K monitor at the same time via Thunderbolt/miniDisplay.
</p>
<p>
I thought that it was time to get on the phone with Apple and try and get some clarification on the whole situation. (Because I bought the Mac Pro in July 2014 with the three-year AppleCare coverage, I am still under warranty until July 2017, so I figured I would take advantage of it before it was too late.)
</p>
<p>
The first representative I talked to was predictably useless. But she was also humble enough to realize that this was beyond her level of expertise and she immediately referred me to a “special advisor” named Alan. Alan was pretty good and immediately realized that I knew what I was talking about. He didn’t have too much expertise on the Mac Pro with multiple displays himself, but he was able to do some digging and find <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/SP697?viewlocale=en_CA&amp;locale=en_CA">another web page on the Apple site</a> that seemed to be more up to date, and actually said that the 2013 Mac Pro had the following specifications:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>Display Support</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Connect up to:
<ul>
<li>Three 5K displays</li>
<li>Six Thunderbolt displays</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
That was more like it! But now the question was: If the Mac Pro did indeed support up to three 5K displays, how come I could not get it to work with one 5K display and one 4K display?
</p>
<p>
First of all, Alan drew my attention to the original page on the Apple web site titled “<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202801">Use multiple displays with your Mac Pro (Late 2013)</a>”. While the information was obviously outdated (compared to the other page) the diagram did indicate that, while the Mac Pro had six Thunderbolt/miniDisplayPort connections, all six were not interchangeable, and the underlying technology was based on <strong>three</strong> Thunderbolt buses only. Two ports were for Bus 1, two ports were for Bus 2, and the last two were for Bus 0, with the Mac Pro’s HDMI port <strong>also</strong> being on Bus 0.
</p>
<p>
What this meant is that, if, say, you did want to try to connect three 5K displays to the Mac Pro, you’d have to connect each display (with its two required mDP connections) to a different bus. It also meant that, even for a single 5K display, the two mDP connections for the display had to be on the same bus, and that presumably would free up the other two buses for other displays.
</p>
<p>
So we tried that while I was on the phone with Alan. I put the 5K display on Bus 1, and tried to connect the Sharp 4K display on Bus 2. It still didn’t work. Ditto with Bus 0. Alan had no idea why. Finally, he suggested trying to connect the Sharp 4K display via HDMI instead, just out of curiosity. I did have a spare HDMI cable, so I tried and… it worked! Success! I had two displays again… except that HDMI on the Mac Pro doesn’t support 60 fps for such a high resolution, so I had to use the 4K Sharp at 30 fps instead, which didn’t feel very smooth. It was tolerable for a secondary display, but not great.
</p>
<p>
Alan agreed with that, and said that he would have to talk to his sources in engineering to find out why I wasn’t able to connect the 4K display via mDP.
</p>
<p>
Then, out of curiosity (but also because I had always dreamed of having not just two, but three displays on my desktop), I asked Alan if we could try connecting the 30&#8243; Apple Cinema Display with the mDP-to-DVI adapter back to the Mac Pro as well. But we got nothing. That didn’t seem right, since that monitor wasn’t even a 4K display. But something appeared to be seriously wrong since I had connected the 5K display.
</p>
<p>
Alan said to leave it with him and he would get back to me.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, because I am an experienced troubleshooter, I decided to try a couple more things. First of all, I noticed that, when I connected the 30&#8243; Apple Cinema Display with the mDP-to-DVI adapter to the Mac Pro, the small white LED on the Cinema Display wouldn’t even come on, even when I pressed the Power button. (The Cinema Display has one of these frustrating touch Power buttons that have no physical state and no moving parts. You just tap on it and assume that it registers it as meaning “ON”. Tapping on it in this case, even repeatedly, produced nothing.) I also noticed that the connection between the power brick and the cable was a bit frayed. I had never noticed this before, but I wondered whether things were hanging by a thread and my moving things around one more time had finally caused the physical connection to give up the ghost, even though it only looked like the insolation around the electrical wiring was a bit exposed.
</p>
<p>
So I brought my old 2009 Mac Pro back up from the basement and tried connecting the Cinema Display to its DVI port directly. And… it worked just fine. The monitor came on, with the small white LED glowing, and everything was peachy. So the damaged physical connection to the power brick was not an issue, and the monitor itself worked fine. Could there be something wrong with the mDP-to-DVI adapter, then? After all, when I checked the reviews for the product on Apple’s web site, they were far from glowing, and several people complained about failures after a few months…
</p>
<p>
Well, I had one way to find out: I could try plugging the Cinema Display with the mDP-to-DVI adapter to my wife’s iMac 5K upstairs. I tried that, and… it didn’t work. The Cinema Display had the same symptoms as with my Mac Pro: No picture, no white LED coming on, no matter how many times I pressed that frustrating touch power button.
</p>
<p>
So it started to look like the mDP-to-DVI adapter had all of a sudden died on me, at the same time I had decided to set up a new 5K display for my Mac Pro. Too much tinkering for its taste?
</p>
<p>
Then my troubleshooter’s mind continued to whir and I started wondering about the cable connection between the Sharp 4K and the Mac Pro. One thing that made me a bit suspicious at that stage was that, for the past year or so, I had been experiencing weird problems with my Sharp 4K display and the Mac Pro: Sometimes, when I would wake the display from sleep, only half of it would come back on, and the other half would stay black. When that happened, even rebooting the Mac Pro didn’t help. The only solution that I had found was to physically unplug the DP-to-mDP cable from the Sharp to the Mac Pro on the Sharp’s side and plug it back in. I could even do that without rebooting the Mac Pro. (Thunderbolt/Mini DisplayPort is plug-and-play.) The only problem is that, of course, when I did that, macOS would reshuffle all my windows, because I would be temporarily back to one monitor only. So I would have to manually reorganize my windows each time this happened, which was an annoyance. Then in more recent months I had noticed a new problem with the Sharp 4K display and the Mac Pro: Sometimes, while I was working, half of the Sharp screen would go black for a few seconds and come back on, or the entire screen would go black and then come back on. I could go days without a single incident, or sometimes it would happen several times a day. Rebooting the Mac didn’t seem to make any difference. Since this particular had started more recently, I had good reason to believe that both issues (the screen staying half black after sleep, and the screen going half black or completely black randomly) were actually software bugs, the second one having been introduced by a more recent system update. (I know from experience that bugs that only affect a small subset of users can fly under the radar for a long time, so nothing surprises me anymore.)
</p>
<p>
But now, in light of these new developments coinciding with my purchase and installation of the new 5K display, I started wondering whether there was something else going on, and maybe it was a hardware problem with the Sharp 4K itself or with the cable. The only way to find out for sure was to test the Sharp 4K with a different cable… except that I didn’t have another mDP-to-DP cable. I only had the dual mDP-to-DP cable for the Dell 5K, and that single mDP-to-DP that originally came with the Sharp 4K and now looked somewhat suspicious to me. I could probably use one half of the dual mDP-to-DP cable with the Sharp 4K, but then I couldn’t use the Dell 5K at the same time. And since I could no longer use the Cinema Display with mDP-to-DVI adapter with the Mac Pro either, I was kind of stuck… I could order a new single mDP-to-DP cable online, of course, but it would take at least a few days to arrive, and I wanted to test things <em>right away</em>.
</p>
<p>
So I did the only thing that I could do, which was to take my Sharp 4K display upstairs and try to use one half of the dual mDP-to-DP cable from Dell to connect it to my wife’s iMac 5K. And guess what? It worked like a charm.
</p>
<p>
This seemed to indicate that the Sharp 4K itself was not the culprit, and that the problem was indeed with the single mDP-to-DP cable that originally came with the Sharp display, which might have been defective from the start or at least for a long time (hence the problems I had been having with the Sharp 4K and the Mac Pro, with half of the screen going or staying black) and might just now have died altogether.
</p>
<p>
There was only one way to prove this conclusively, which was to order a new mDP-to-DP cable from NewEgg. I figured that, while I was at it, instead of ordering a new mDP-to-DVI adapter from Apple, which was expensive, I would also order a cheap DVI-to-HDMI adapter from NewEgg and try to use that to connect the Cinema Display to the Mac Pro (via the HDMI port, which is on Bus 0). I could have the Dell 5K with the dual mDP-to-DP cable on Bus 1, the Sharp 4K with a new single mDP-to-DP cable on Bus 2, and the Cinema Display with an HDMI adapter on Bus 0. That <em>should</em> work.
</p>
<p>
I ordered the stuff. It came within a week, and I was able to confirm everything, i.e. that the single mDP-to-DP cable from Sharp was indeed toast, and that the Cinema Display worked with the Mac Pro via HDMI… except that this flavour of HDMI (at least) is limited to a 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution, which of course is significantly lower than the Cinema Display’s native resolution.
</p>
<p>
I got back to Alan with all this information (which meant that I had effectively done his work for him, but never mind…). We were both a bit shocked by the very weird fact that <strong>both</strong> my single mDP-to-DP cable from Sharp and my mDP-to-DVI adapter from Apple seemed to have failed <strong>at the same time</strong>, and also at the same time that I decided to purchase and install a new 5K display for my Mac Pro! I mean, what are the odds? (Maybe engineers familiar with these technologies are aware of vulnerabilities that can come to the surface when trying to fiddle with stuff. I don’t know…)
</p>
<p>
Finally, I had a decision to make. I now knew for a fact, not only that I could have both the 5K and the 4K displays with my Mac Pro (which was already great), but also that my Mac Pro could support even more and could actually have a <strong>third</strong> display as well, which has always been a dream of mine. (As far as I am concerned, the more screen real estate, the better.) But the Cinema Display via HDMI had a limited resolution. In order to get the full resolution, I would have to get another mDP-to-DVI adapter. It wasn’t a cheap solution, and the reviews about Apple’s adapter were not too reassuring. So I took another leap of faith and decided to order yet another new monitor for my Mac Pro.
</p>
<p>
Of course, I wasn’t going to order another 5K display. For one thing, it would be too expensive. Then it would use up two more Thunderbolt/Mini DisplayPort connections on my Mac Pro, leaving me with <strong>only one</strong> left for hard drives. (The displays don’t come with their own Thunderbold/mDP ports for daisy chaining.) I wanted to have at least two connections free for hard drives (one for my drives in the basement and one for portable drives that I need to connect from time to time). Finally, a 5K resolution is only really important for the main, central display that I am looking at most often. For displays on the side, which I only look at more occasionally, it is not nearly as significant. In an ideal world, of course, all my displays would be 5K. But in the real world, with the state (and cost) of technology as it is today, having two or three 5K displays is overkill and makes little sense.
</p>
<p>
I settled for a Dell P2715Q instead. Physically, it’s almost identical to the 5K display. It has a 4K resolution. It had good reviews. And it wasn’t too expensive. I thought that, as another secondary display, it would do just fine.
</p>
<p>
I went to order it from NewEgg and… noticed that, while they still listed the Dell 5K, all their offers were “currently out of stock”. So I didn’t really have the option to get another 5K display anyway… (I’ve since seen indications online that the only current option for a 5K display for the Mac is the recently released <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/shop/product/HKN62LL/A/lg-ultrafine-5k-display">LG 5K display</a>, which already has a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/03/07/lg-ultrafine-5k-back-in-stock/">history of problems</a> that does not inspire confidence, and — officially, at least — <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT207448">only works at 5K with recent MacBook Pro laptops</a> anyway.)
</p>
<p>
So I ordered the Dell 4K fro NewEgg.ca, and it came within a few days. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that it had a more old-fashioned matte finish, as opposed to the glossy finish of the Dell 5K. Glossy is fine for my main display (even though I don’t particularly like it), but I realized, upon installing this third display, that if it had had a glossy finish, that would have been a bit of a problem, because this third display on the left had to be on an angle and would therefore catch some of the light coming from my office window. So I was quite pleased that it had a matte finish.
</p>
<p>
As expected, this third display worked with a single mDP-to-DP cable on the Mac Pro’s third bus. I had to tinker with the resolutions of the two side displays for a while in order to find the optimal setup, but I finally ended up with this arrangement:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.betalogue.com/images/uploads/hardware/3displays2017.png" target="_blank" title="Click to see full-size image."><img alt="3displays2017" height="306" src="https://www.betalogue.com/images/uploads/hardware/3displays2017.png" width="390" /></a>
</p>
<p>
The central display is the Dell 5K at the “Default for display” resolution, which is Retina, i.e. an apparent resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels (actually 5120 x 2880 pixels).
</p>
<p>
The Dell 4K on the left is at a scaled resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels, which is not Retina, since the display’s native resolution is 3840 x 2160 pixels, but still looks <em>almost</em> as good as Retina when looked at from an angle at a greater distance from the eyes than the Dell 5K at the center of my desk.
</p>
<p>
And the Sharp 4K on the right is also at a scaled resolution, of 3008 x 1692 pixels, which, again, is not Retina, since the display’s native resolution is also 3840 x 2160 pixels, and is also not the same as the 2560 x 1440 resolution of the Dell 4K, because the Sharp 4K is physically bigger and can display more. Again, it doesn’t look as good as Retina, and for small font sizes there is a bit of eye strain on occasion, but on the whole, for most real-world applications, it works fine, and does look fairly close to Retina from an angle and at a greater distance.
</p>
<p>
The most important thing for me in this setup is that there is no significant change in the size of the UI elements when moving from one screen to the other. With these resolutions, it really does look almost like one extra-wide continuous desktop. I can easily move things from one screen to the next either manually or with <a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/">Keyboard Maestro</a> macros. It is definitely a significant improvement over my previous two-display setup, not just because of the improved quality of the displays, but also because there is much less of a discrepancy between the main display and the other displays.
</p>
<p>
In spite of my initial fears about buying non-Apple displays and about the risks associated with purchasing equipment whose use with a Mac Pro was not very well documented online, I must say that the setup was relatively painless. (The major pain described above was caused by the defective cable and the defective adapter. Without these defects, the transition would have been significantly smoother.) The only slight problem I encountered was that the default configuration of the Dell 5K included some sleep setting that didn’t agree with the Mac’s own sleep feature. I was sort of prepared for this by what I had read online, so I knew right away that I probably had to tinker with the Dell 5K’s own internal menu feature. I used that feature to turn the Dell 5K’s own sleep feature off, and now the display seems to go to sleep properly whenever I use macOS itself to put all my displays to sleep (via a hot corner).
</p>
<p>
The Dell 4K didn’t have any such problem and worked properly with macOS’s sleep feature right out of the box.
</p>
<p>
And how does it <em>feel</em> to work with these displays on a daily basis? Well, I have to admit that there was a period of adjustment when I first got the Dell 5K display. I was underwhelmed by the brightness levels that it was capable of (compared to the Sharp 4K) and the glossy finish took a little while to get used to. I had to turn the brightness up to a level that is very near the maximum that it is capable of, and I also had to turn the brightness of the Sharp 4K down a bit. The Dell 4K is pretty close to the 5K in term of its brightness. The whites on the Sharp 4K are a bit bluer than on the Dell displays, but I was able to calibrate things so that all three displays are pretty close in that respect, and indeed they are much closer to each other than my Sharp 4K and my Apple Cinema Display ever were. (The Apple Cinema Display’s whites were always much yellower than the Sharp 4K’s, no matter which calibration I used.)
</p>
<p>
Now that the Dell 5K has been discontinued, I am very happy that I managed to buy one when I did. Apple might come up with its own new range of displays in the future, but I am far from convinced that they’ll make any effort to support older Macs when they do. And since no other option is currently available, I am really glad that the reseller that I bought the display from through NewEgg.ca still had one in stock.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to this hardware upgrade, and to the <a href="https://www.betalogue.com/2017/01/24/macos-10-12-sierra-on-mac-pro/">relatively painless upgrade to macOS Sierra</a> in early 2017, it really feels like my 2014 Mac Pro has been given a new lease on life, and this is almost as good as getting a new computer. It means that I certainly won’t have any problem waiting for Apple to come up with a new Mac Pro next year and won’t feel any pressure to be an early adopter of that new machine (as long as nothing breaks in this Mac Pro).
</p>
<p>
The 2013 “trashcan” Mac Pro might not have been a great success, but it works well for me, with the adaptations that I was able to make, namely with the use of external Thunderbolt hard drives relegated to the basement via a 30-foot Thunderbolt 2 cable so that I don’t have to hear them, and now with the use of a three-display setup that includes one central Retina display with a decent amount of screen real estate (unlike a 4K display used in Retina mode, which really doesn&#8217;t provide enough screen real estate) and two side displays with near-Retina resolutions.
</p>
<p>
None of this was cheap, but in my line of work, my computer is my main business expense and it is worth spending the extra amount to get something that I am really comfortable working with.</p>

Here is a very simple example of something that is fundamentally wrong in macOS in its current incarnation.
</p>
<p>
STEP 1: In the current version of Numbers for macOS 10.12 (Sierra), which is Numbers 4.1.1, select a cell:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="numbers4-speed1" height="142" src="https://www.betalogue.com/images/uploads/numbers/numbers4-speed1.png" width="514" />
</p>
<p>
STEP 2: Now press the <kbd>=</kbd> key on your keyboard, which is a shortcut for inserting a formula in the cell:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="numbers4-speed2" height="142" src="https://www.betalogue.com/images/uploads/numbers/numbers4-speed2.png" width="514" />
</p>
<p>
(In passing, note the <strong>mouse cursor</strong>, which is not right either. In its current position, the mouse pointer should not be an I-beam, but an <strong>arrow</strong>. But that’s another long-standing issue in macOS, which has been <a href="https://twitter.com/betalogue/status/840306037005647873">well documented</a>, not that it has made any difference so far.)
</p>
<p>
STEP 3: Now click on the cell above. This inserts a reference to the cell in the formula that you’ve started editing:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="numbers4-speed3" height="142" src="https://www.betalogue.com/images/uploads/numbers/numbers4-speed3.png" width="514" />
</p>
<p>
Great! Everything is peachy, right?
</p>
<p>
Er, not quite. See, there is a slight problem if you happen to be a fast user who makes full use of his/her two hands to avoid wasting time on repetitive tasks. If you go <em>too</em> fast between STEP 2 and STEP 3, Numbers completely fails to insert the cell reference in the formula. It <strong>completely ignores your mouse click</strong> in STEP 3. It’s as if you never did click.
</p>
<p>
How on earth is this possible? Can I really be too fast for my computer? How can a 2014 Mac Pro with tons of RAM be incapable of keeping up with my very human motor skills, no matter how fast I am?
</p>
<p>
If, for whatever reason (e.g. because of a background process), Numbers was slowed down and had trouble keeping up with me, at the very least it should be able to record my actions in a <strong>buffer</strong> and execute them once it’s back to its normal state. Yet there’s nothing significant going on in the background (I can reproduce this at will, under any circumstances), and it clearly is <strong>not even buffering</strong> my actions!
</p>
<p>
There’s something fundamentally wrong with this. And, before you ask, it’s not an isolated problem, a problem that might be limited to Numbers and to this particular scenario.
</p>
<p>
I constantly encounter situations, in my daily use of my system, where macOS is <strong>unable to keep up with my user actions</strong>, whether it is while I am typing text on the keyboard or executive a sequence of actions with the mouse or keyboard shortcuts — and where it also <strong>fails to buffer the actions that it appears to be unable to keep up with</strong>.
</p>
<p>
The end result is that macOS is constantly losing track of my user actions and forcing me to repeat them — i.e. to delete the phrase that it mangled (by missing some letters even though I did type them) and retype it, to undo accidental mouse actions that happened because macOS missed a step or two, etc. — thus severely disrupting my workflow.
</p>
<p>
How can this be acceptable? How can Apple not have noticed this pervasive problem? How could this even be treated as “good enough” by Apple?
</p>
<p>
My guess is that, as always, there is a confluence of reasons explaining this situation.
</p>
<p>
First of all, there is the fact that it is intermittent, and impossible to reproduce at will. Right there, it means that the bug, no matter how serious it is, will not be a top priority for Apple. There’s a flaw in their very system for identifying bugs and dealing with them that makes intermittent bugs, no matter how serious they are when they do occur, much harder to report, get processed, and get fixed.
</p>
<p>
And not only is it an intermittent bug, but it’s also hard to report, even by experienced bug reporters such as myself. How do you provide evidence of user actions that the system does not even seem to have detected? When I type a phrase in a word processor and I <em>know</em> that I have typed it properly, without skipping any letters and without making any typos, and yet what appears on the screen does not match what I typed, how do I <em>prove</em> this to Apple? Nobody is here next to me filming my fingers on the keyboard and ensuring that I did indeed type what I said I typed. Similarly, nobody is there monitoring my every mouse click or keyboard shortcut, and keeping an exact chronological log of all the user actions that my hands are executing.
</p>
<p>
I also suspect that part of the reason why this problem is underreported and not treated seriously enough by Apple might be that today’s hardware is, paradoxically, fast enough to mask the problem fairly well, so that it doesn’t happen often enough, or in a way that is egregious enough and common enough to prompt action on Apple’s part. It’s telling to me, for instance, that the application where it happens most often for me is… Microsoft Word 2016, which is, generally speaking, the most sluggish, most unresponsive piece of macOS software that I have to use. So the underlying general sluggishness of that particular application appears to exacerbate the problem and, sure enough, that’s the application where it occurs most frequently. But it’s by no means the only application where it occurs. I see the problem even in Apple’s own macOS applications, including Mail, TextEdit, and Safari, only less often than in Word. And I bet there aren’t many engineers at Apple who use Word on a regular basis. (Let’s not even wonder here how many Microsoft engineers use Microsoft Word for macOS for any serious work. If they did, they would probably die of shame.)
</p>
<p>
In addition, I believe that the fact that I use certain third-party tools, such as <a href="http://www.ergonis.com/products/typinator/">Typinator</a>, to partially automate text entry in all my applications, causes me to be more vulnerable to the issue. Typinator lets me type abbreviations and automatically replaces them with expansions, and it also automatically corrects my most frequent typos. I have hundreds of abbreviations memorized and corrections recorded, and I use them all the time. It makes me much more productive. But I cannot deny that I often notice hiccups in the flow of text on the screen <strong>during</strong> those automatic expansions and corrections. And typically, when this happens, while the expansion or correction eventually happens after a second or two, macOS inserts a few more of the characters that I typed <em>after</em> the abbreviation, and <em>then</em> there is a whole bunch of characters missing, which macOS somehow failed to buffer. I have discussed the issue with the Typinator developers at Ergonis and they argue that they are unable to reproduce the problem themselves, and that, in any case, even if some hiccups occurred, macOS should buffer the rest of the characters properly and spill them out eventually. I don’t think that the Ergonis folks are trying hard enough to reproduce my problem, for instance by using hundreds of abbreviations and corrections all the time like I do, while typing very fast, but I also believe that they are fundamentally right and that, even if it makes the problem more obvious, their software cannot be blamed for what appears to be essentially a system-wide failure to buffer user actions — including text input and keyboard shortcuts and mouse actions — properly.
</p>
<p>
But of course, how can I convince Apple that this is serious, in light of all the above factors? I am quite sure that there is not a single macOS developer at Apple who uses Typinator like I do, in Mail, TextEdit, Safari, Microsoft Word, Nisus Writer Pro, BBEdit and all kinds of other applications. In fact, I am quite sure that there are very few people among Apple’s engineers or even Apple’s testers who are actual writers and who strive to be as productive in their writing as I do. Some of them might have noticed something a bit odd here and there, but because it’s not exactly a deal breaker (like an application crash or a system freeze) and it’s so hard to circumscribe properly, it’s not particularly surprising that nothing is being done about it (as far as I can tell).
</p>
<p>
That is why I chose to start with the simple, obvious, easily reproducible problem in Numbers described above. It’s far from being the most pressing issue for me (I don’t execute this particular sequence of actions more than a few times a day maximum, and most of the time I am not fast enough to encounter the problem). But it’s symptomatic of a larger problem, and I had to start somewhere. Of course, there is a risk that the problem in Numbers will be seen by whomever reads this as isolated and relatively unimportant, but that’s beyond my control (although such a reaction would be symptomatic of what’s wrong with the Mac today, where “attention to detail” has become little more than an old myth).
</p>
<p>
It’s possible that, if I stopped using Typinator altogether in my daily computing, I would experience the buffering problem much less frequently. But how can this be justified? Typinator is an excellent tool that greatly enhances my productivity, by enabling me to type thousands of words per day. I wouldn’t be nearly as productive without it. It works fine most of the time. Also, I just cannot accept the fact that a machine as powerful as my Mac Pro, with all its processing power, cannot handle a task as simple as properly buffering all my user actions without exception. This, to me, is a fundamental flaw in macOS, and one that must be fixed.
</p>
<p>
I just don’t know how to get Apple to acknowledge it and do something about it.
</p>
<p>
I know for a fact that I am not the only one experiencing hiccups in text input. Just the other day, I was discussing it with a friend of my wife’s, who was staying with us for a week. She is retired and has been using an iMac for several years. When I mentioned my frustration about the fact that I had such a powerful machine and that it couldn’t even keep up with my typing, she confirmed that she too had noticed unexplained hiccups in text input on hers. And she doesn’t use any kind of third-party utility like Typinator! She’s not a power user by any stretch of the imagination. She doesn’t type lots of text all day long. And yet she too has noticed it… (I didn’t clarify with her whether her observations also included buffering problems, i.e. not just hiccups, but actual characters failing to be recorded by the system and vanishing into the ether. One cannot expect ordinary users to be so in tune with what’s going on in their system to clearly notice and understand such things.)
</p>
<p>
How many other Mac users are there out there who are aware of this problem and as annoyed by it as I am? It all started in Lion, if memory serves, on my 2006 Mac Pro, and that’s a long time ago. Still, nothing has been done to fix it, as far as I can tell, and, two other Macs and several macOS upgrades later, it’s still there.
</p>
<p>
What is it going to take?</p>

    <p>In February, I spoke at <a href="http://www.webstock.org.nz/17/">Webstock</a>, a conference that takes place in Wellington, New Zealand. Video from my talk is <a href="http://www.webstock.org.nz/talks/humanities-x-technology/">now</a> available.</p>

<p>I spent two weeks in New Zealand and loved every minute. I'd heard New Zealand is a lovely country - "Have you seen Lord of The Rings?" -  but I wasn't prepared for how breathtakingly beautiful it is. At some point I stopped trying to take photos, because nothing accurately captured what I saw with my own two eyes.</p>

<p>During the first week of my trip, I was in Wellington for Webstock. The night before the conference started, the organizers planned a special event to welcome the speakers. I had an incredible time meeting and getting to know the brilliant professionals assembled by the organizers. Seriously, look at the <a href="http://www.webstock.org.nz/17/all-speakers/">lineup</a>. </p>

<p>The attendees at Webstock were one of the most gracious and thoughtful groups I've had the pleasure of speaking with post-talk, giving a high level of respect for my time and emotions. And best of all, I just felt comfortable in the space. Webstock is the rare tech conference with gender parity, a feat owed to the amazing job of the organizers.</p>

<p>After the conference, I went to the South Island, spending a week driving along the West Coast. The entire experience was an awesome adventure, one I'll cherish forever.</p>

<p>Thank you Webstock for an amazing conference and trip. It was an absolute honor and pleasure to be included.</p>

        • by Pierre Igot
      
      
    </p></div>
    <p>
As you know if you’ve read my <a href="https://www.betalogue.com/2016/12/18/video-freezes-on-mac-pro/">recent blog posts</a>, I’ve had a bit of a torrid time with my 2014 Mac Pro in the past few months, because of a recurring problem with random video freezes.
</p>
<p>
It turns out that, contrary to what I had believed earlier on, the problem was not hardware-related, but <a href="https://www.betalogue.com/2017/01/21/video-freezes-software-after-all/">software-related</a> (and possibly related to a recent security update, more specifically).
</p>
<p>
While my Mac Pro is working more or less normally again now, this whole ordeal had two very concrete consequences for me.
</p>
<p>
First of all, it (indirectly) led me to purchase a new iMac 5K for my wife as a replacement for her aging 2009 Mac Pro, which gave me the opportunity to discover first hand the joys of desktop computing with a Retina display. This prompted me to experiment with my own existing hardware setup (the 2014 Mac Pro driving a 4K screen and an older 30&#8243; Apple Cinema Display), by switching the 4K monitor from its native 3840 x 2160 resolution to the scaled 1920 x 1080 resolution that effectively gives me a Retina display for my main screen.
</p>
<p>
It took me a little while to adjust to the reduced screen real estate and to fine-tune my virtual work environment accordingly, but I am quite happy with the results. That said, I am still planning on purchasing a 5K monitor to replace my current 4K + 30&#8243; setup with a 5K + 4K setup that is entirely Retina. I was considering the <a href="http://www.dell.com/ae/business/p/dell-up2715k-monitor/pd">Dell UP2715K</a>, but it looks like it’s being discontinued and replaced by something else, although what that “something else” is going to be is not clear at all. (The site says, “<span class="passage">Please see our recommended replacement product</span>”, but then it does not show what that replacement product is, as far as I can tell.)
</p>
<p>
I feel that the switch to Retina will give my 2014 Mac Pro a bit of a new lease on life. It looks like the most egregious bugs related to Retina have been addressed, and the computer has enough power to handle the new setup. I’ll be able to say more when I have made the full switch.
</p>
<p>
The second major consequence of this mishap with the Mac Pro is that it forced me to upgrade to Sierra sooner than I was planning to (by a few weeks at least, since the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT207462">10.12.3 update</a> has actually just come out).
</p>
<p>
After my <a href="https://www.betalogue.com/2015/04/15/os-x-10-10-3-responsiveness-issues/">very traumatic experience with early versions of Yosemite</a> and <a href="https://www.betalogue.com/2016/03/18/el-capitan-upgrade/">my much smoother transition to El Capitan</a>, which I only upgraded to when it had reached 10.11.3, I was planning on waiting for 10.12.3. But the video freeze issue in El Capitan forced me to upgrade sooner.
</p>
<p>
I am happy (and relieved!) to report that the upgrade from El Capitan to Sierra 10.12.2 was quite smooth, and that I am positively surprised by the overall solidity of the new system. After the upgrade, I was able to run my machine for more than a week without having to restart it a single time for any reason, and most things run as well, if not better, than they did in El Capitan.
</p>
<p>
I was a bit worried about the <a href="http://tidbits.com/article/16966">PDF-related issues reported with Sierra</a>, because I use all kinds of PDFs on a daily basis in my work, and Preview is my preferred PDF viewer. I must admit, however, that I personally haven’t noticed any significant differences or encountered any bugs. On the contrary, it looks like a bug introduced in Yosemite’s Preview in 2015 when <a href="https://www.betalogue.com/2015/03/09/yosemite-preview-window-resizing-continued/">resizing a window that contains a PDF document too fast</a> has finally been fixed. This does not mean that the PDF bugs affecting other people are not important, of course. It just means that, for the types of tasks that <em>I</em> have to complete with PDF documents, Sierra seems to be working fine.
</p>
<p>
I am also happy to report that Sierra fixes other problems that had plagued my computing environment for a long time. It fixes several sleep-related issues that I had. For example, even with Power Nap enabled, I was unable to get El Capitan’s Mail to keep checking for new mail all through the night. Typically, I would wake my computer in the morning and find that it still had to download a bunch of messages that had arrived through the night. This is important, because <a href="https://c-command.com/spamsieve/">SpamSieve</a> needs to have Mail checking for new mail regularly on my desktop computer in order to filter out spam on my iOS devices.
</p>
<p>
I also had, for years, an issue where <a href="http://www.ergonis.com/products/typinator/">Typinator</a> would be unable to reliably play some specific sound effects after my computer had been put to sleep. This meant that, for years, I had to quit and relaunch Typinator each and every morning. (I had a <a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/">Keyboard Maestro</a> macro for this, of course, but it was still annoying.) This audio problem appears to finally be gone in Sierra.
</p>
<p>
I didn’t encounter any new incompatibilities in Sierra, even with old software that I am still using and that will never be updated again, such as <a href="http://help.blackpixel.com/kb/netnewswire/downloading-netnewswire-3">NetNewsWire 3</a>, from 2012, and the CD-ROM-based French dictionaries Le Grand Robert and The Collins-Robert French Dictionary, also from 2012. (Time will tell how far into the future these continue to work, but I really do not feel like giving the Le Robert company any more of my money for a subscription to its online versions, based on the very poor customer service that they offer and the poor quality of their software in the first place. I only use these dictionaries because they are valuable as dictionaries. As for NetNewsWire, I suspect that one day I’ll have to find another RSS reader, but I am OK with delaying that process for as long as possible.)
</p>
<p>
I was quite disappointed to see that Sierra does not fix a number of long-standing issues in the Finder. The text-label highlighting in background windows is still <a href="https://twitter.com/betalogue/status/814913722879737856">broken in column view</a> when dragging and dropping files. I don’t know how much more obvious this bug needs to be for Apple to finally do something about it. Similarly, another bug that is much harder to reproduce and that sometimes causes the Finder to <strong>completely fail to highlight the destination of a drag-and-drop operation altogether</strong> is still there. Since that one is intermittent, I suspect that Apple is still in complete denial about its very existence.
</p>
<p>
I am still occasionally experiencing significant problems in Sierra with <strong>the mouse pointer failing to change when it is supposed to</strong>. This can affect all applications systemwide. But it’s also an intermittent problem, and so, until I can find a 100%-reliable scenario to reproduce it, I am afraid I am going to have to continue to live with it.
</p>
<p>
In fact, after I posted about my disappointment with the persistence of these issues in Sierra on Twitter, I got a reply from @AppleSupport asking me to contact them by direct message to further explore the issues. (I didn’t direct the original tweet at @AppleSupport. I only used the handle @apple to refer to Apple in the tweet. I guess that’s enough to prompt a canned response.) I did respond to the invitation, and ended up having to explain things to a “senior advisor” on the phone. He did agree that he could reproduce the highlighting issue in the Finder and said that he would forward an “<span class="passage">FYI</span>” (his word) to engineering about it. He wasn’t able to reproduce the mouse pointer issue, so he asked me to try and reproduce it in a clean user environment and phone him with the results. Of course, I cannot reproduce the problem reliably, so that’s a dead end.
</p>
<p>
The process was rather time-consuming and yielded dubious results. I won’t go through it again. @AppleSupport needs to do a better job of distinguishing between calls for help and reports on bugs. Since they don’t seem to be able to do so, I guess I shall refrain from referring to Apple by its Twitter handle in the future. I’ll stick to <a href="http://bugreport.apple.com/" target="_blank">Bug Reporter</a>, even though that’s time consuming too (those huge uploads of system data!) and also has dubious results.
</p>
<p>
I am also disappointed to report that the hiccups that have been affecting text input on the Mac since Lion still haven’t been eliminated. I regularly encounter them in applications such as Mail and TextEdit, and they are particularly bad in Microsoft Word 2016, which is such an atrocious piece of software to begin with.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft seems to be simply unable to produce an application for the Mac that is both powerful and lean. Word 2016 might be powerful, but it’s a clunky monster and it’s slower than any other Mac application for the most basic stuff, including text input. Things are so bad in Word that the hiccups that are clearly a flaw in the operating system itself can significantly interfere with your typing and can even cause the application to completely lose track of what you’ve been typing altogether, effectively letting clusters of letters vanish into the ether. (They are not even buffered properly!) The combination of text input flaws in the operating system and Word’s own clunkiness is simply disastrous.
</p>
<p>
While things are not worse, in that respect, in Sierra than they were in El Capitan (where they were marginally better than in Yosemite), they are not significantly better either, and whenever I have no choice but to work in Word, I fear the worst, most of the time with good reason.
</p>
<p>
It continues to boggle my mind that, with all the power that we have under the hood in a machine such as a 2014 Mac Pro, we still have to deal with responsiveness issues of the most basic sort. How on earth is a 2014 Mac Pro not fast enough to process my typing in real time, no matter how fast I type — I’m only human, after all — and no matter what other processes are happening in the background at the same time?
</p>
<p>
This remains, to me, one of the most shocking developments in recent years in Macintosh computing. Clearly, Apple’s own priorities lie elsewhere, and they don’t care enough about the needs of Mac users whose primary use of their computer is to compose text by <em>typing</em> it.
</p>
<p>
Siri on the desktop? I couldn’t care less. I don’t even a microphone for audio input! (It’s also worth noting that even disabling Siri doesn’t stop Sierra from <a href="https://twitter.com/betalogue/status/817477153663098882">wasting resources</a> on things such as background “speech recognition” processes…)
</p>
<p>
Basically, what I would like is a system that always processes text input in real time, with no exceptions, and lets me view text in full Retina glory on large, bright monitors. Once I get my 5K monitor, I might be closer than ever to that ideal, but until Apple finally addresses text input responsiveness issues in a real way in macOS, I will still have to endure a life of ongoing frustration with the poor use of hardware resources by my software tools.
</p>
<p>
That being said, Sierra remains, as far as I am concerned, a solid release. It’s no solid enough to make me fully trust Apple again, and I will certainly remain wary of future system updates and upgrades, but at least my system today is as good, if not slightly better, than it was a year ago. And I guess that, the way things are going, that’s a minor miracle.</p>

    </p></div>
    <p>
I have an update on the situation with my Mac Pro that I <a href="https://www.betalogue.com/2016/12/18/video-freezes-on-mac-pro/">blogged about in December</a>…
</p>
<p>
Back then, I indicated that the unpredictable video freezes that I had been experiencing for a while appeared to be gone after I had had one of my video cards replaced by Apple under warranty.
</p>
<p>
If you <a href="https://twitter.com/betalogue">follow me on Twitter</a>, you know that this is not where the story ends.
</p>
<p>
In fact, after the video card swap on December 11, the Mac behaved properly for exactly two weeks and then… out of the blue, I started experiencing video freezes again, on December 25. (Yes, on Christmas day!) The symptoms were exactly the same again: normal behaviour for a long time, and then, all of a sudden, a cascade of temporary video freezes, accompanied by the display of this error message in the system log:
</p>
<p>
<code>Mac-Pro kernel[0]: stalling for detach from AMDTahitiGraphicsAccelerator</code>
</p>
<p>
The video freezes would last several minutes, and then things would go back to normal… until the next time, which could be 15 minutes later, 12 hours later, or 72 hours later. There was no way to predict it.
</p>
<p>
How was this possible? This clearly indicated that the problem was not fixed by the video card swap, and that the “purple tinge” that the Genius Bar staff member had noticed with my video card when using his advanced testing tools was unrelated to the actual problem. Swapping the video card might have fixed the “purple tinge” (which I never experienced myself under normal conditions), but it didn’t fix the video freezes.
</p>
<p>
Needless to say, since the video freezes started happening on Christmas Day, I didn’t do anything about them right away. Apple’s services were closed on December 25 and 26 anyway, and I figured that they would be swamped with calls on December 27 from people with trivial problems with their new Apple-made Christmas gifts. So I knew I had to wait a few days.
</p>
<p>
I also was on holiday and didn’t exactly relish the thought of spending several hours of that time off on the phone with various Apple representatives trying to convince them to do something about the problem.
</p>
<p>
So I just continued using my computer normally, trying to put up with the freezes and not let them drive me mad. Then, the next time they happened, I noticed something that I hadn’t noticed before. One of the ways that the problem first manifested itself was not necessarily with a complete video freeze of the entire interface (except the mouse pointer), but with a web page failing to load in Safari. A page that I had just visited a moment ago and wanted to go back to wouldn’t load. Instead, I would be faced with a blank window, with no explanation. My Internet connection was still working fine, but Safari would refuse to load/display the web page. Somehow other web pages in other tabs or windows would still work fine for a while… And then eventually the video freezes would extend to the entire interface, and I would have to go through the entire thing again.
</p>
<p>
When this particular version of the problem occurred, it jigged my memory, and I remembered something that I hadn’t thought about in a while, which was that I had noticed a similar problem (web pages failing to load for no apparent reason) long before I started experiencing the video freezes affecting the entire user interface for extended periods. It had been fairly rare, and at the time, I had not tried to troubleshoot the problem, precisely because it was fairly rare and I had simply filed it under the “General Crappiness of Apple Software These Days” category (subcategory: “Impossible-to-Reproduce Crappy Software Problems for Which Bug Reporting Would Be a Waste of Time”).
</p>
<p>
But now, this new episode led me to think that, maybe, just maybe, the video freezes that I had been experiencing lately were just a more severe and intrusive manifestation of a long-standing problem… which in turn led me to think that, maybe, just maybe, it wasn’t a hardware problem after all.
</p>
<p>
I obviously couldn’t know for sure, but the theory that the video freezes were a software problem was worth revisiting…
</p>
<p>
But what could I do about it if it was a software problem? Well, I was still running El Capitan at the time, because <a href="https://www.betalogue.com/2015/04/15/os-x-10-10-3-responsiveness-issues/">my experience with early versions of Yosemite back in 2015</a> had made me extremely wary of being an early adopter of major system upgrades. My original plan had been to wait until version 10.12.3 of Sierra before trying it on my Mac Pro. Sierra was currently at 10.2.2. What if I took the chance and tried to install Sierra on my Mac Pro now, in order to see if, by any chance, the upgrade might, inadvertently or not, contain a fix for the video freezes?
</p>
<p>
I figured that I didn’t have too much to lose at that stage, and that if I didn’t do it now, there was a good chance that Apple’s representatives would ask me to try to do that anyway as part of the process of further troubleshooting the freezes.
</p>
<p>
So I took all the usual precautions (full backup, application upgrades that hadn’t been done yet, reading about potential problems with Sierra) and then I took the plunge, on December 26.
</p>
<p>
Well, today is January 21, and I am happy to report that I have not experienced a single recurrence of the video freezes accompanied by the “<code>stalling for detach</code>” error messages in the system log.

<p>
So it looks like Sierra (at least version 10.12.2) does contain a fix for the problem. As you can imagine, it’s a huge relief for me. I don’t have to go through the time-consuming process of trying to get Apple representatives to acknowledge the seriousness of the situation and provide me with a solution. I have a computer that works well again, and does <em>not</em> have a hardware flaw after all.
</p>
<p>
There is an epilogue to this story, however. Since December 26, I have heard from a <a href="https://twitter.com/FriendlyAshley">fellow Twitter user</a> who has been experiencing similar problems, albeit on a completely different machine (a MacBook Pro). She too has been experiencing video freezes, along with “<code>stalling for detach</code>” error messages in the system log. (In fact, it’s through a Google search for this phrase that she found my blog post about my problem.)
</p>
<p>
In her case, her MacBook Pro has video freezes and displays the <a href="https://twitter.com/FriendlyAshley/status/817127078692798464">following message in the log</a>:
</p>
<p>
<code>stalling for detach from AMDVerdeGraphicsAccelerator</code>
</p>
<p>
Same message with a different flavour of graphics accelerator… We now had a clearly strong sign that the problem was indeed software and not hardware. (In retrospect, the very fact that the freezes were accompanied by error messages in the log was a sign that it was a software problem. Hardware problems typically occur at a level that the system is not even aware of, and cause freezes or kernel panics without a trace of the reason why in the logs.)
</p>
<p>
Still, like me, she was told by Apple that her video card might need to be replaced. She had just got it replaced, and based on my experience, I now warned her that there was a good chance that it wouldn’t fix the problem. Sure enough, two days later, she had more video freezes.
</p>
<p>
I told her that I had upgraded to Sierra and that it <em>seemed</em> to have fixed the problem, but that it was still too soon for me to tell for sure. (Now that nearly a month has elapsed, I am quite sure.)
</p>
<p>
She decided to stick with El Capitan for a while, because she was wary of the <a href="http://tidbits.com/article/16966">PDF-related issues reported with Sierra</a>. (To be honest, the reports of bugs with Preview had also worried me quite a bit before then. However, while I do use PDFs in my work quite a bit, I haven’t really noticed any significant problems in my workflow with Sierra yet, and I have been back at work for two weeks now. Of course, your mileage may vary…)
</p>
<p>
And then…
</p>
<p>
On January 17, Apple <a href="http://tidbits.com/article/16999">released an updated version of Security Update 2016-003 for El Capitan</a>, dubbed “Security Update 2016-003 Supplemental”. And guess what? The release notes indicated that the update to the update addressed “<cite>a kernel issue that could cause a Mac running El Capitan to occasionally freeze and become unresponsive</cite>”. Mmm…
</p>
<p>
Of course, when my own video freezes started getting serious, in November 2016, I did wonder whether any recent system update might have been the culprit. But the only update that I had installed during that time was an early build of that very security update, which I got as part of my involvement in the <a href="https://appleseed.apple.com/sp/projects">Apple Seed program</a>. And since it was “only” a security update, and since my problem clearly seemed to be a video problem, I figured that there was no way that the two were linked. (I actually remember mentioning that update to the Apple senior representative who had taken care of me in December. He didn’t think there was a connection either.)
</p>
<p>
Now, of course, in light of these new developments, I do have to wonder whether my own video problems were not caused by that update. The timing seems to confirm it, except for the fact that I do remember experiencing the occasional blank page in Safari long before last fall… Still, it is also possible that there was an underlying problem before the security update, but that the security update just made it way, way worse, at least for some Macs.
</p>
<p>
Also, when you look at the details about the security update that Apple provides on <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207423">this page</a>, you can see that it contains fixes for security bugs that do involve things like “<code>AppleGraphicsPowerManagement</code>”, “<code>CoreGraphics</code>”, and “<code>CoreMedia External Displays</code>”. So it is not too far-fetched to think that the security update might have introduced (or amplified) low-level issues that did involve the video part of the system.
</p>
<p>
My Twitter friend has now installed the Supplemental version of the security update and, so far, she hasn’t experienced any further problems. It’s probably still a bit too soon to tell for sure. (I’d give it a whole month myself to be certain.) But it now appears quite likely that the video freezes that we both experienced, accompanied with these “<code>stalling for detach</code>” error messages in the system log, were not hardware problems, and were indeed either caused or made much worse by the original version of Security Update 2016-003, and that Security Update 2016-003 Supplemental does fix them.
</p>
<p>
Still, both she and I had to go through the process of dealing with (relatively) clueless Apple representatives and had to waste time getting our computers serviced for nothing. We might have got brand-new video cards out of the deal, but that does not, of course, compensate for all the grief caused by the bug.
</p>
<p>
And, as usual, I cannot help but wonder whether there is really nothing that Apple can do to improve its process for dealing with serious bugs. If this problem was indeed caused by Security Update 2016-003, why were the Apple representatives that we dealt with not aware of it? Why did they instead suggest useless hardware repairs? And why was the bug fixed silently without telling us? Where is the knowledge base article on Apple’s web site that describes the problem that we experienced in full detail, with clear reference to the exact symptoms <strong>and</strong> to the “<code>stalling for detach</code>” error messages in the system log?
</p>
<p>
What if other people are still experiencing the exact same problem and are looking for help today? How will they know to install Security Update 2016-003 Supplemental, especially if they are inclined to avoid installing new updates right away, precisely because they don’t trust that Apple can produce bug-free updates in the first place?
</p>
<p>
Something is rotten here, and <a href="https://twitter.com/tclementdev/status/821003771044069376">other reports online</a> about this lack of transparency tend to confirm it. Apple needs to realize that bugs cost us time, therefore money, and that, unlike their own representatives and senior representatives, we don’t get paid for the time we spend trying to work around these bugs or get them fixed.
</p>
<p>
Will we ever get a new attitude at Apple that not only transparently communicates about such crucial bugs, but also <strong>apologizes</strong> for the significant inconvenience that they cause?</p>

    <p>I started thinking about the history of my first PC recently while reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Valley-Birth-Personal-Computer/dp/1937785769/">Fire in the Valley</a>, a book on the history of the PC revolution. </p>

<p>On Christmas in 1995, I unwrapped a shiny new IBM Aptiva. Much to my delight, my mom had gifted me my first PC. </p>

<p>Each time I've thought about my mom making this purchase, it's been thru the lens of someone looking back in time. Reading Fire in the Valley reminded me that I'd never before put myself in my mom's perspective and thought about her making the decision within the context of being a parent without a technical background in 1995.</p>

<p>So, I asked my mom about the purchase. And since it's 2016, I asked over text message. Below is our conversation:</p>

<p>...And this is where we end.</p>

<p>To bring this story full circle, this year for Christmas I bought my mom her first MacBook Pro.</p>

    <p>
Ever since I upgraded to Microsoft Office 2016 on my Mac, I have been experiencing this recurring bug.
</p>
<p>
Word 2016 works OK for many days. (I say “OK” and not “great” because Word never works great, even at the best of times.)
</p>
<p>
Then all of a sudden, for no apparent reason, it becomes unable to open or save documents. The application starts displaying all kinds of error messages, like the following:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="word2016-cantopen" height="162" src="https://www.betalogue.com/images/uploads/microsoft/word2016-cantopen.png" width="433" />
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, if you are in the process of working on an existing document that you’ve been saving regularly using <kbd>Command-S</kbd> until now, all of a sudden Word starts complaining that it can no longer save the document (which might leave you stranded if you made lots of changes since the last time you saved the document).
</p>
<p>
Sometimes, weird problems like this one can be remedied by quitting and relaunching Word. Not in this case, though. If you try to quit and relaunch Word, you then get the following message:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="word2016-cantopentemplate" height="163" src="https://www.betalogue.com/images/uploads/microsoft/word2016-cantopentemplate.png" width="431" />
</p>
<p>
In other words, at this stage it looks like Microsoft Word 2016 has become unable to open any file, including its own Normal template file. To make matters even more scary, if you click on “<span class="interfaceitem">OK</span>” to continue and then try to quit Word the normal way, when trying to quit, Word displays the following error message:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="word2016-cantopensavetemplate" height="161" src="https://www.betalogue.com/images/uploads/microsoft/word2016-cantopensavetemplate.png" width="431" />
</p>
<p>
Don’t click on “<span class="interfaceitem">Yes</span>”! (It won’t actually do anything, since Word is currently unable to open or save anything, but it’s still not a good idea.) If you click on “<span class="interfaceitem">No</span>”, Word still fails to quit. So at that stage the only option is to force-quit Word.
</p>
<p>
You can try this whole cycle multiple times just for fun if you want to, but whatever option you choose in those misleading error dialog boxes, nothing will work, and Word won’t go back to normal.
</p>
<p>
The whole problem happened to me again this afternoon. Normally, when it happens, I have found that the only solution was to <strong>reboot the entire computer</strong>. Today, however, I had a little time, so I decided to do more sleuthing.
</p>
<p>
My first reflex was to go to the Console and see if I could notice any error messages that might help better circumscribe the problem.
</p>
<p>
I first noticed that, even time I tried to relaunch Word, the system log would include something like this:
</p>
<pre>
16-12-22 14:50:16,765 Microsoft Word[50336]: ApplePersistenceIgnoreState: Existing state will not be touched. New state will be written to /var/folders/sp/fgbr368s4_q5_rbzb_4k5w740000gn/T/com.microsoft.Word/com.microsoft.Word.savedState
</pre>
<p>
So I figured that the problem might have to do with some kind of conflict between Word and OS X’s built-in application resuming feature, which normally causes an application to reopen the windows that were left open the last time the application was quit.
</p>
<p>
Of course, the irony here would be that OS X’s Resume (or “Persistence”) feature has <strong>never</strong> been supported by Microsoft. Word 2016 has never been able to reopen the windows that were left open the last time it was quit, even when the general setting in OS X’s System Preferences (under “<span class="interfaceitem">General</span>”) is as follows:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="osx-resumesetting" height="63" src="https://www.betalogue.com/images/uploads/macosx/osx-resumesetting.png" width="425" />
</p>
<p>
Based on this message in the Console, Microsoft’s lack of support for this OS X feature clearly does not prevent OS X itself from trying to apply it to Word 2016, even if it does not do anything.
</p>
<p>
So my first troubleshooting step was to try and see if I should clear whatever “saved state” might linger in my system for Word 2016 and relaunch the application. I went to:
</p>
<p>
<span class="filename">~/Library/Saved Application State/com.microsoft.Word.savedState/</span>
</p>
<p>
and cleared everything inside that folder and tried to relaunch Word, but that didn’t work.
</p>
<p>
I then went to the exact location mentioned in that message in Console:
</p>
<pre>
/var/folders/sp/fgbr368s4_q5_rbzb_4k5w740000gn/T/com.microsoft.Word/com.microsoft.Word.savedState/
</pre>
<p>
and I cleared everything that was there and tried to relaunch Word, but that didn’t work either.
</p>
<p>
Finally, I tried to launch Word 2016 while holding the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key down. This did make a difference, in that Word 2016 no longer displayed the message saying that it was unable to open the Normal template. But that’s easily explained if you consider that starting Word up while holding the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key down effectively launches Word in a so-called “safe” state, for troubleshooting purposes. In that “safe” state, Word no longer tries to open the Normal template, in case the template itself is the source of whatever trouble you are trying to address. (It is <em>not</em> the source of the trouble in this case, which can be demonstrated by the fact that the whole situation is resolved by simply rebooting the entire system. After that, Word 2016 works fine again, with the same Normal template.)
</p>
<p>
After launching Word 2016 successfully in a “safe” state, however, I found that it was still unable to open files. So the problem was not fixed.
</p>
<p>
Basically, this whole process suggested that the problem had nothing to do with OS X’s Resume/Persistence feature and couldn’t be fixed by fiddling with the folders involved in that feature, and that the error message in the Console didn’t really mean anything significant. (I was able to confirm this later on by finding that the error message still appeared upon launching Word even when Word was working normally again.)
</p>
<p>
I then paid closer attention to the other references to Microsoft Word in the system log in the Console, and found multiple occurrences of another suspicious-looking message:
</p>
<pre>16-12-22 15:43:17,268 Microsoft Word[61532]: NSAllowAppKitWeakReferences=YES</pre>
<p>
I had no idea what it meant, but I decided to try and find out if anyone online had ever referred to this “<code>NSAllowAppKitWeakReferences</code>” variable in the context of troubleshooting Word 2016.
</p>
<p>
I first found a <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7526794?tstart=0">thread on Apple Discussions</a>, but that thread discussed a different problem (Microsoft Error Reporting quitting unexpectedly) and nothing is the thread was helpful in my situation.
</p>
<p>
Then I found <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_word-mso_mac/release-1522-fix-for-word-documents-not-saving/35ae5689-be5f-4ce0-97ce-62c440fd7b51">this thread on the Microsoft Community forum for Office 2016 for Mac</a>. It contained lots of the usual bullshit about things being Apple’s fault, Microsoft allegedly having fixed (or not fixed) the problem, Microsoft allegedly having noted that multiple users were reporting the problem and being supposedly working on a solution, Microsoft not being involved in these “<span class="passage">user-to-user</span>” discussion forums even though a user named “<span class="passage">Erik J</span>” had “<span class="passage">[MSFT]</span>” appearing next to his name, etc.
</p>
<p>
And then I saw the very last message in the thread, from that Erik J who might or might not work for Microsoft, who mentioned the following troubleshooting steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Close Word.</li>
<li>Click the magnifying glass icon in the top right corner of your screen, type <code>Terminal</code>, and press <kbd>Return</kbd>.</li>
<li>In the Terminal window that opens, type the following and press <kbd>Return</kbd>: <code>defaults write com.microsoft.Word ForceTempFilesInAppContainer 1</code></li>
<li>To ensure that this setting worked,</li>
<ul>
<li>Open a Finder window, and press <kbd>Command+Shift+G</kbd>.</li>
<li>Type the following path: <span class="filename">~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Word/Data/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Temp</span></li>
<li>Press <kbd>Return</kbd>. Upon launching Word, this folder will be created if it doesn&#8217;t exist, and Word will create a temp file inside it. Quitting Word will then cause this temp file to removed, which tells us that the new setting has taken effect.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<p>
I don’t really know what this does, but I tried it this afternoon on my machine after Word 2016 started acting up and refusing to open or save any file, and… it fixed the problem!
</p>
<p>
After typing the above-mentioned <code>defaults</code> command in Terminal and relaunching Word, I found that it was back to normal, able to open the Normal template without trouble and able to open and save files as expected.
</p>
<p>
Given that Erik J does not give any further information and that it is the last post in the thread (dated August 19, 2016), I don’t know if it’s a permanent fix or a temporary one, or if it’s even meant to be a fix. All I know is that it seems to work on my machine for my copy of Word 2016, and that this seems to indicate that, if the problem occurs again, I might be able to fix it without having to reboot my entire machine, which is of course a significant relief.
</p>
<p>
One ironic aspect of the whole process is that, after all this, I discovered that, even when Word 2016 was back to working normally again, it still caused the recurrence of the <code>NSAllowAppKitWeakReferences=YES</code> error in the system log. So maybe that error in itself doesn’t mean anything either, but actually just guided me to the right forum.
</p>
<p>
I will post a link to this blog post on the forum at the end of that discussion thread, and maybe Erik or someone else at Microsoft will notice it and maybe (yeah right) get back to me with a request for more information or a confirmation that this is a fix (and that it will be included in a future update). Whatever happens, I figure the most useful thing that I can do for fellow Word 2016 users is to write about the whole thing in a blog post, so there you are.</p>

    </p></div>
    <p>I fixed a bug in a client's iOS app that I want to share, particularly because I couldn't find a write-up or solution during my research into the root cause of the problem.</p>

<p>The bug occurred during video playback. Each time the user tapped play, AVPlayer would first show the underlying view. This momentary transparency was not ideal, resulting in what amounted to a "camera flash" effect on the screen before each video was played.</p>

<p>I started debugging by first checking the app's configuration of AVPlayer, but I didn't spot an obvious issue. So I turned to Google, looking for a baseline of normal behavior for AVPlayer, and found <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/AVBasicVideoOutput/Introduction/Intro.html">example code</a> Apple released in 2013.</p>

<p>Apple's sample project <sup id="ref1"><a href="http://ashleynh.me:80/fixing-avplayer-playback-transparency/#fn1">1</a></sup> plays a video selected from Camera Roll, and if you run it, you'll notice that playback occurs without a quick flash of transparency.</p>

<p>At this point, I knew something was wrong with the client's app, and not AVPlayer's API. But what was the culprit? I double-checked the configured properties for AVPlayer and AVPlayerItem, changing the client's app for parity between the two projects. But the bug persisted.</p>

<p>Taking a step back, I thought about the differences that remained between the two apps. Apple's example project played videos that were in Camera Roll, recorded using the Camera app. And the client's app played videos that were made in the client's app. </p>

<p>...wait a second. Was this the issue? Could the video file be the root of the problem and not AVPlayer?</p>

<p>To test this theory, I downloaded one of the videos made in the client's app, dropped it into Apple's example project, and made a couple of quick changes so that Apple's project would use the video I added instead of one selected from Camera Roll. I ran the project and <em>voilà</em>, the same initial flash of transparency reproduced in the example project.</p>

<p>At this point, it was obvious to me that the videos recorded in the client's app were at fault. Curious, I opened one of the client's app-created <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/99yio1985vq6snb/bad_video.mov?raw=1">videos</a> in Finder preview, and dragged the seek bar to the first frame. It was then that I noticed the first frame of the video was transparent, revealing <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/niuxslebimuvneq/finder.png?raw=1">the background</a> of Finder preview.<sup id="ref2"><a href="http://ashleynh.me:80/fixing-avplayer-playback-transparency/#fn2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>I looked at the client's code for creating videos and it seemed like a standard use of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/reference/avfoundation/avassetwriter">AVAssetWriter</a>, the class that writes media data to file. A call was made to</p>

<p><code>AVAssetWriter.startSession(atSourceTime:)</code> </p>

<p>to begin a file writing session, and then callbacks were received to the</p>

<p><code>AVCaptureVideoDataOutputSampleBufferDelegate</code></p>

<p>With nothing obvious at fault in the code, I started reading the documentation for AVAssetWriter, and saw the following in the explanation for <a href="https://developer.apple.com/reference/avfoundation/avassetwriter/1389908-startsession">startSession(atSourceTime:)</a>:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the earliest buffer for an input is later than startTime, an empty edit will be inserted to preserve synchronization between tracks of the output asset.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This "empty edit" sounded exactly like what was being inserted into the beginning of the client's app-created videos. I looked at how the client's app was appending buffers to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/reference/avfoundation/avassetwriterinput">AVAssetWriterInput</a> and noticed that the code never ensured the <strong>first</strong> buffer appended to the file had the same time as the <code>startTime</code> of the video. </p>

<p>As a fix, I added simple logic to ensure that the first buffer appended to a new video file always had the same time as the <code>sourceTime</code> passed to <code>AVAssetWriter.startSession(atSourceTime:)</code>. After this change was made, the client's app started producing videos like <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/s3rempxq8i4g7t0/fixed_video.mov?raw=1">this</a> one.<sup id="ref3"><a href="http://ashleynh.me:80/fixing-avplayer-playback-transparency/#fn3">3</a></sup> Notice how it's initial frame is the opaque first frame of the video.</p>

<p>The biggest lesson reinforced here is to always break down complicated bugs by isolating their components into separate projects. Look for examples released by Apple, a respected developer, or create your own. I find this sanity check of knowing how a component or class behaves by default is always helpful in those moments when nothing seems to work.</p>

<hr />

<p><sup id="fn1">1. I was not excited when Apple announced Swift. I loved Objective-C. I was used to Objective-C. This test project was the first meaningful Objective-C code I worked with after several consecutive months of Swift development. Somewhere in that time, a shift in my thinking must have occurred, because using Objective-C suddenly felt bulky and kludgy in comparison. <a href="http://ashleynh.me:80/fixing-avplayer-playback-transparency/#ref1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩&#xfe0e;</a></sup></p>

I don’t know it is bad luck or something else, but I have certainly experienced my share of <strong>hardware flaws and failures</strong> with Apple products over the years. I am not talking about more or less predictable failures here, like conventional hard drives failing after a few years, or power adapter cords becoming frayed (although I’ve certainly had my share of those as well, of course). No, I am talking about hardware issues that were due either to clear design flaws or to defective parts.
</p>
<p>
The first significant one that I can remember is the <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/tip-for-improving-powerbook-g4-titanium-airport-reception/">problem with wifi reception</a> on the original Titanium PowerBook G4 back in 2001. (While this was never officially acknowledged, the titanium shell of the laptop effectively acted as some kind of Faraday cage and had a significantly detrimental effect on wifi reception on the laptop, which, as you can imagine, was a massive disappointment.)
</p>
<p>
Then, in 2003, I had a Power Mac G4 MDD that was affected by a <a href="https://www.betalogue.com/2003/02/22/power-mac-g4-mdd-noise-resolution/">major noise problem</a> with its power supply unit. The problem was so bad that an online petition was started, and eventually Apple had to offer a replacement program for those affected.
</p>
<p>
That G4 MDD was replaced by a Power Mac G5 in 2005, and that machine worked well for a while, but then after less than a year I started experiencing all kinds of random freezes. Apple was never able to fix the problem, and eventually offered to <a href="https://www.betalogue.com/2006/12/22/from-the-g5-quad-to-the-mac-pro/">replace it with a Mac Pro</a>.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, in 2006, I also purchased a new black MacBook for my wife and, for the first time ever, I had to <a href="https://www.betalogue.com/2006/06/04/macbook-the-mooing-noise-disaster/">send the machine back and ask for a refund</a>, because it had unacceptable noise issues that were treated by Apple as “normal” or “working as expected”.
</p>
<p>
In 2007, I ended up purchasing a 17&#8243; MacBook Pro instead, and it worked OK for a while, and then the machine started developing a problem with a <a href="https://www.betalogue.com/2010/11/29/macbookpro-battery/">bulging battery</a>.
</p>
<p>
Still in 2007, I started having kernel panics with my 2006 Mac Pro that required a <a href="https://www.betalogue.com/2013/08/01/fix-for-kernel-panics/">logic board swap</a>.
</p>
<p>
In 2009, I started experiencing <a href="https://www.betalogue.com/2012/09/20/osx1082-kernelpanics/">kernel panics on my 2009 Mac Pro</a> with dual video cards (to drive two monitors). These kernel panics were clearly due to a software issue, but since the software issue only affected a small subset of users (those with two video cards), Apple never did acknowledge it, and I ended up opting to purchase an <a href="https://www.betalogue.com/2013/08/01/fix-for-kernel-panics/">expensive replacement video</a> card of a different kind just to work around the problem.
</p>
<p>
That 2009 Mac Pro worked fine after that (and is, in fact, still going strong today in late 2016, with a third-party SSD as its system volume and with that replacement video card), but I eventually replaced it with a 2014 Mac Pro as my main work machine.
</p>
<p>
While I had <a href="https://www.betalogue.com/2015/04/15/os-x-10-10-3-responsiveness-issues/">major responsiveness issues</a> with the 2014 Mac Pro when running the early versions of Yosemite (a very annoying software problem), I didn’t have any really significant hardware issues for the first couple of years. (This Mac has some occasional Thunderbolt-related glitches, and there is also a noticeable high-pitched whine at times when the machine is running a bit hot, but these are relatively minor.)
</p>
<p>
Then, a few weeks ago, I started experiencing something new. For no apparent reason, out of the blue, the Mac Pro started experiencing <strong>video freezes</strong>. During these freezes, everything on the screen would be completely frozen except for the mouse pointer, which would continue to move normally, although nothing would respond to mouse clicks. Sometimes, the mouse pointer would eventually turn into the <a href="http://www.thexlab.com/faqs/sbbod.html" target="_blank">Spinning Beach Ball of Death</a> and nothing would happen for several minutes, so I would end up forcing a hard reboot, by holding the Mac Pro’s power button down for five seconds.
</p>
<p>
Most often, however, each freeze would last about 20 or 30 seconds, and then things would become responsive again, but only for a few seconds. OS X would try to execute some of the mouse actions that I had attempted while the screen was in the process of becoming frozen (which had obviously been stored in a buffer by the system), but then after a few seconds, everything would freeze again. The same cycle would repeat a few times, and then eventually things would go back to normal.
</p>
<p>
In addition, sometimes, at the same time the screen would freeze, I would see some video corruption, typically in some part of the main Mail Viewer window in Mail:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.betalogue.com/images/uploads/hardware/2014macpro-videocorruption.jpg" target="_blank" title="Click to see full-size image."><img alt="2014macpro-videocorruption" height="209" src="https://www.betalogue.com/images/uploads/hardware/2014macpro-videocorruption.jpg" width="319" /></a>
</p>
<p>
Like the freezes, the corruption would eventually clear up.
</p>
<p>
Luckily, this problem happened at a time when I hadn’t done any significant system updates in a while, except for a security update for El Capitan. So I was able to relatively easily rule out a software problem. (I still did suspect the security update for a while, although it was very unlikely, because I am still part of the AppleSeed program, and had installed early builds of it before the final, official release.)
</p>
<p>
From the very beginning, my 30 years of experience troubleshooting Mac computers for myself and for clients suggested to me that this was a hardware issue. I still went through all kinds of routine troubleshooting steps (zapping the PRAM, emptying caches, etc.), especially since, at the beginning, it looked like the problem would typically happen right when I would attempt to load a graphics-rich web page in Safari.
</p>
<p>
Of course, the problem was intermittent and impossible to reproduce reliably. It would just happen seemingly randomly. Sometimes I would go a couple of days without a single freeze. Sometimes I would get two or three freezes in a single day. It didn’t seem connected to what I was doing at the time either, except for the fact that it most often occurred while browsing the web with Safari (a very common activity, of course).
</p>
<p>
I tried to run the Mac Pro’s hardware test from the recovery partition, but the test failed to identify any issue (which didn’t prove anything, since the problem was very intermittent).
</p>
<p>
I ended up getting on the phone with AppleCare. (I had purchased the three-year warranty for the Mac Pro back in July 2014, so it was still covered.) The phone representative was relatively competent and made me execute a few typical troubleshooting steps, including some that I had already done and some that I had not. She said to give it a try and get back to them if it didn’t solve the problem.
</p>
<p>
It didn’t. I did some more research and found that the system log in Console would, around the times of the freezes, contain multiple occurrences of an error message looking like this:
</p>
<p>
<code>Mac-Pro kernel[0]: stalling for detach from AMDTahitiGraphicsAccelerator</code>
</p>
<p>
I tried to find references to this online and was not very successful. But I did find <a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mac-pro-late-2013-gpu-driver-issues.1860297/">this thread on the MacRumors forums</a>, which appeared to confirm that this kind of problem was either with the GPU driver software or with the GPU cards themselves. (I also tried some low-tech troubleshooting steps, like trying to get rid of whatever dust might have accumulated inside the Mac Pro, and also switching Thunderbolt cables around, in case the problem was some kind of weird glitch with the video signal over Thunderbolt. Nothing helped.)
</p>
<p>
After a few days, I was on the phone again, and this time I didn’t have too much trouble getting the person to understand that I knew what I was talking about and that I had effectively “done my homework”. I told her quite bluntly that a trip to the Apple Store would be a four-hour round trip for me and that I hoped she would try and minimize the need for such trips, by ensuring that they were as useful and constructive possible.
</p>
<p>
Still, she couldn’t guarantee that the Apple Store folks in Halifax (Nova Scotia) would readily accept my request to swap the graphics cards. All she could do was to set up an appointment so that I could bring my machine to someone at the “Genius Bar” and get them to have a look at things.
</p>
<p>
With winter and nasty, unpredictable weather approaching, I took the next available appointment, which a few days later, on a Tuesday, at 10:40 am.
</p>
<p>
I arrived on time for the appointment, but the “Genius Bar” was obviously very busy with all kinds of folks getting one-on-one lessons on fairly straightforward stuff (as far as I could tell from the conversations I overheard). I had to wait for about 10 minutes, and then finally got to talk to someone about my problem. To her credit, she quickly realized that the issue was beyond her level of expertise and she summoned someone in the back, who showed up after a few more minutes.
</p>
<p>
He seemed to know his stuff, and proceeded to run a number of more “advanced” tests. Fortunately for me, he quickly noticed something odd, which had nothing to do with what I was experiencing: Whenever he tried to run his special testing software, the whole screen would take on a purple tinge. He asked me if I had ever noticed such a purple tinge while running the Mac Pro. I told him that I had not. But he was definitely able to reproduce this (and not my freezes) reliably while running his tests and this, to him, was reason enough to initiate a repair process that would involve ordering two replacement video cards and a replacement logic board (since he said the graphics problem could be located at the site of the connection between the video cards and the logic board).
</p>
<p>
They would have to order the parts and then try them in the machine to see if it made any difference (to the purple tinge problem, obviously). He said the whole process should take three to five days.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, since I only had consumer-level warranty coverage, my only option was to either go home with my Mac Pro and continue to use it for a few days, then come back in when the parts were in and leave the Mac Pro with them for who knows how long. I didn’t exactly relish the prospect of multiple round trips to Halifax, especially because of weather issues and also because of the typical shopping rush before the holidays.
</p>
<p>
Then I had to make a quick decision. I thought that my wife was currently still using my 2009 Mac Pro, which would turn eight years old in a few months. As I said, that 2009 Mac Pro with an SSD (bought from Other World Computing several years ago, and actually replaced once under warranty since the original purchase) and with a replacement video card was still working fine, but there was no denying that it was getting old. Also, my wife never liked the fact that she had to deal with a big tower, which was, of course, too powerful for her needs and, most important, rather noisy (relatively speaking) for her home office environment. So I figured that now was as good a time as any to replace her own computer with a more recent Mac, and the obvious (albeit rather expensive) option was to get her a 27&#8243; iMac 5K. Provided that they had one in stock, I would leave the Mac Pro at the Apple Store and use that new iMac 5K as a replacement for my work machine until the repair was complete.
</p>
<p>
Granted, the iMac 5K model itself had not been upgraded by Apple in a year, and I would be spending a significant amount of cash on a model that was not exactly brand new and didn’t have the very latest technology (USB-C/Thunderbolt 3, etc.). But my wife didn’t really need the very latest technology and, besides, my experience as an early adopter (of both hardware and software) in the past 15 years has been decidedly mixed. It would also give me a real chance to put the iMac 5K to the test in my own work environment, to see if it might ever be considered as a potential replacement for my 2014 Mac Pro (given that the Mac Pro has been completely neglected since 2013 and that there is sadly a real chance that it will <a href="https://marco.org/2016/11/05/world-without-mac-pro">eventually be discontinued altogether</a>).
</p>
<p>
The Halifax Apple Store did have the 27&#8243; iMac 5K in stock, but only with Fusion drives (an SSD-only iMac can only be had through the built-to-order process) and only with 8 GB of RAM. I asked if they could at least upgrade the iMac to 16 GB, and they were able to do that in under an hour. So we left my Mac Pro at the Apple Store and went home with a new 27&#8243; iMac 5K with 16 GB of RAM and a 2 TB Fusion drive.
</p>
<p>
For the next 24 hours or so, I attempted to use the iMac as my work machine without restoring my full work environment from my backup, by only installing what I thought I really needed, since it was only for a few days. That was a mistake. My work environment is heavily customized, with tools such as <a href="http://www.ergonis.com/products/typinator">Typinator</a>, <a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/">Keyboard Maestro</a>, <a href="https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html">LaunchBar</a>, and so on. In addition, some other tools that I use on a regular basis, like the <a href="http://www.lerobert.com/grands-dictionnaires/le-grand-robert-coffret-numerique-pour-pc-ou-mac-edition-limitee.html">Grand Robert French dictionary</a> on CD-ROM, are very poorly supported by the developer, and I soon found that, while the CD-ROM still works fine in my customized work environment, I couldn’t get it to work in a brand new environment. (The software would crash every time I would attempt to “authenticate” it by inserting the original CD-ROM. There was no hope of getting any help from the developer on a timely basis.)
</p>
<p>
So I ended up restoring my work environment from the backup just the same, even though it was a backup of the startup volume for my Mac Pro, and not of a startup volume for an iMac. The process took a while, and there was a scary moment at the end, when I attempted to boot the iMac from the restored work environment and I just got a black screen. I managed to solve the problem by rebooting with the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key down, forcing the iMac to start in Safe Mode and, while that was quite slow, it did work, and after that I was able to boot normally.
</p>
<p>
I was pleasantly surprised to find that the iMac was perfectly able to drive both its internal 5K display and my external 4K monitor as a main display via Thunderbolt. This meant that it was relatively easy for me to restore a fully functional work environment with two displays, the iMac effectively replacing my second (and older) 30&#8243; Cinema HD display. (Even my Keyboard Maestro macros for moving windows from screen to screen still worked, because the “virtual” resolution of the 5K display obviously matched the normal resolution of my older 30&#8243; display.)
</p>
<p>
And I must admit that I was more than pleasantly surprised by the quality of the 5K display itself. Now that I have experienced it, I can say without any reservations that my dream work environment right now would be to have a new Mac Pro that is able to drive two large 5K displays side by side. Sadly, such a machine does not exist, and we might have to settle for an improved iMac 5K that is able to drive one or two external 5K displays — if such a machine ever gets made.
</p>
<p>
I have no idea whether Apple is slowly abandoning its desktop computer lineup or not. It certainly feels that way these days. Needless to say, it would be news of catastrophic proportions for us professional users. The irony would be that it would happen just as the hardware capabilities in the industry are finally getting where we want them to be (i.e. affordable computers able to drive multiple affordable 5K screens).
</p>
<p>
The other concern I had about the iMac on my desktop was about the noise. The Mac Pro is near silent (except for that occasional high-pitched whine) and all my conventional storage (with hard drives) is in another room, with a 30-ft optical Thunderbolt connection through the wall. The iMac on my desktop brought a conventional hard drive (the conventional part of the Fusion drive) back within earshot. The noise was definitely noticeable, but I must admit it wasn’t really significant.
</p>
<p>
Of course, I didn’t really try to do anything hardcore, like exploiting the computer’s multiple cores to encode a large video file, for instance. So I don’t really know how noisy the iMac 5K <em>can</em> get. But I do know now that, under regular circumstances, doing the stuff that I regularly do, the noise level remains low and is quite acceptable. It’s not perfectly silent, but then nothing really is. It is very quiet, and if I had to choose between this constant low-grade white noise and the occasional whine coming from my Mac Pro, I am honestly not sure which I would choose.
</p>
<p>
So, I did eventually manage to work with the iMac as my main work machine for a few days, and, on the fourth day (a Saturday), I got a call, around… 8 pm, from the Apple Store, letting me know that they had swapped one of the video cards, and that the problem, as far as they were concerned, appeared to be fixed (which, presumably, meant that the purple tinge was gone).
</p>
<p>
I knew that a friend of mine was going to Halifax the next day, and he had already offered to pick the machine up for me if it was ready. So I told the Apple Store representative on the phone about this, and he said that it wasn’t a problem, that I could just give him my friend’s name and he would add it to the file as a person authorized to pick up the computer on my behalf.
</p>
<p>
The next day (Sunday), I got another call from the Apple Store, telling me that they had someone there to pick up my computer, and… that person was not authorized. With all the high tech that they have for managing their support calls and repair jobs, they obviously still are vulnerable to human error, or whatever the reason for this mix-up was. In any case, I repeated the name again, and it was OK.
</p>
<p>
My Mac Pro was back at home later in the evening, and I set things up again the following day. Everything was in working order, and I just had a backlog of a few days of daily tasks (filing emails away, transferring newer files, etc.) to complete before I was fully back in business.
</p>
<p>
I didn’t get any video freezes on that first day, but I figured I’d better wait for a few days at least before drawing any conclusions. It’s now been seven days, and I still haven’t had a freeze. I have also checked that there is no longer any occurrence of the “<code>stalling for detach from AMDTahitiGraphicsAccelerator</code>” message in the system logs.
</p>
<p>
So currently the signs are good that whatever problem in the video card caused the freezes was also what caused the purple tinge, and that fixing one fixed the other. After all this, I guess I can count myself lucky that my intermittent freezing problem also happened to have a non-intermittent side effect, which conveniently made the issue obvious and undeniable to Apple’s technicians.
</p>
<p>
Overall, I must admit that my experience with the Apple Store in Halifax for this repair was good. If I hadn’t purchased the extended AppleCare warranty back in 2014, the repair would have cost me nearly $400. With the warranty, it cost me nothing except the time wasted trying to troubleshoot the problem and then dealing with the Apple Store and travelling there to get the problem looked after. (I am obviously not counting the purchase of the iMac 5K here, but I must admit things would have been significantly more complicated for me and my work if I hadn’t seized this opportunity to replace my wife’s aging computer.)
</p>
<p>
I just have one last observation to make about the Apple Store staff. Everyone on the floor in the store does everything on iOS devices (iPhones, iPads): look up information, process payments, record data, etc. I was quite impressed with the staff’s typing skills on their iOS devices, which were obviously much better than mine (with far fewer typing mistakes, as far I could tell).
</p>
<p>
However, I couldn’t help but notice that, when using iOS for things other than typing, like tapping on buttons, links, etc., even with all their obvious experience using these devices, they still very often have to tap on buttons <strong>twice</strong> or even <strong>three times</strong> (or even more times) to get the buttons to respond to their taps. This definitely matches my experience, and I was secretly pleased to observe that I am not the only one, and that even experienced users have this problem.
</p>
<p>
I realize that the mouse is not a perfect pointing device either and that there is a small percentage of missed clicks, missed UI targets, etc. But as far as I am concerned (and, based on my observation, as far as a lot of users are concerned, even experienced ones), the percentage of misses is nowhere near as high as it is with tapping on buttons on a touch screen. Based on this observation alone, I simply don’t see how anyone can argue that a touch screen is an appropriate interface for doing serious work. The rate of wasteful tactile interactions is just far too great. (I have little experience with trackpads, but I suspect that they would fall somewhere in between a mouse and a touch screen when it comes to the error rates.)
</p>
<p>
And let’s not even discuss the replacement of real keyboard keys with “virtual” keys on a miniature touch screen… How often does a press on a keyboard key actual fail, as opposed to a tap on a button on a touch screen?
</p>
<p>
I don’t really know what to think (the worst?) of recent developments when it comes to Apple’s desktop hardware. But I won’t deny that I am quite worried about the long-term future of my use of a Mac computer with two large screens for my work. Will it at least remain viable until I retire (which is not for another 15 years or so!)? I tried to share my concerns as a “business” user with the Apple Store staff in Halifax, who, of course, are quite interested in trying to sell me more “business” products and services, but unfortunately that <a href="https://twitter.com/betalogue/status/809846029210230784/photo/1">didn’t get very far</a>…
</p>
<p>
However, at least now I know that, in the immediate future, if worse comes to worst, I do have the option of replacing my Mac Pro with an iMac 5K. It wouldn’t be ideal and I would still be disappointed, but I could make it work. So that, at least, is partly reassuring.</p>

    <p>The movie <a href="http://www.foxmovies.com/movies/hidden-figures">Hidden Figures</a> hits select theaters on Christmas Day. It tells the story of African-American mathematicians <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Johnson">Katherine Johnson</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Vaughan">Dorothy Vaughan</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Jackson_(engineer)">Mary Jackson</a>, who worked at NASA in the 1960s. Their work helped John Glenn become the first American astronaut to make a complete orbit of the Earth.</p>

<p>For many, this will be the first time they've heard of these women, or the fact that African-American women worked at NASA in a scientific capacity in the 1950s. In fact, all of the stars of the film, including Taraji P. Henson, who plays Katherine Johnson, Janelle Monae, who plays Mary Jackson, and Octavia Spencer, who plays Dorothy Vaughan, assumed the script they were reading was a work of fiction. As Spencer said in an interview “Black women being recruited to work as mathematicians at NASA’s southern installation defies what we think we know about American history.”</p>

<p>In a previous piece named <a href="http://blog.ashleynh.me/on-heroes">On Heroes</a>, I wrote about this exact issue while discussing another of NASA's African-American mathematicians, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Easley">Annie Jean Easley</a>. In the piece, I mention how an African-American astronaut I <a href="https://twitter.com/ashleynh/status/612002097920258048">met</a> hadn't heard of Easley, one of her predecessors. Of special import is the reaction my astronaut friend had upon finding out about Easley's existence, as the disappointment of feeling denied a role model washed over her face. Why do we bury these important figures whose contributions make black and brown girls feel like they have a future in STEM? Why do we bury these stories that expand the possibilities for what black and brown girls feel like they can achieve?</p>

<p>I said it before and I'll say it again: Having visible examples of people that look like you in an aspirational professional field is powerful. They matter. That's why I'm excited about this movie, and the attention it's getting from a national advertising campaign. As a bonus, it's Christmas Day release is a sign of potential Oscar Buzz, giving me hope this movie will be as excellent as I want it to be, and that the conversation around it will continue well into February.</p>

<p>The only way positive, diverse stories get told to a mainstream audience is when the economics make sense. I'll be at the theatre opening day to see this film and I'm encouraging everyone I know to go too. Please show your support.</p>

    <p>Today I'm flying to St. Louis for <a href="http://www.thestrangeloop.com">Strange Loop</a> to deliver one of the keynote talks.</p>

<p>For my keynote, I've expanded my talk on the intersection of humanities and technology, doubling its length to include more examples. I've also refined my pitch to value the humanity of the people who interact with your products as highly as the product's technical details.</p>

<p>I imagine Strange Loop will be quite a different experience from the iOS/Mac community focused conferences I generally attend. This conference brings together a broad, multi-disciplinary group of tech workers from a variety of specialties. As a result, I only know a couple of people attending ahead of time. I'm cherishing the moment to meet people outside of my own specialty, and looking forward to giving my keynote to a wider audience.</p>

    <p>In two weeks, I'm giving the keynote talk at this year's <a href="http://360idev.com">360iDev</a>, held in Denver, Colorado.</p>

<p>For my keynote, I've expanded my talk on the intersection of humanities and technology, nearly doubling its length. This expansion accommodates more examples, and refines my pitch for valuing the humanity of the people who will use your product, as highly as the product's technical details.</p>

<p>360iDev may be the largest indie iOS/Mac developer conference I've ever attended, with up to four talks running in the same time slot. One of the reasons I'm looking forward to the conference is how easy coordinating with <a href="https://twitter.com/jwilker">John Wilker</a>, one of the organizers of 360iDev, has been. I'm expecting a very well run event, to catch up with old friends, meet new ones, and explore a new city.</p>

One of the very few new features that I was (moderately) excited about when I <a href="https://www.betalogue.com/2016/03/18/el-capitan-upgrade/">upgraded to OS X 10.11</a> (El Capitan) was the “<span class="interfaceitem">Shake mouse pointer to locate</span>” option in System Preferences > Accessibility > Display:

</p>
<p>
After a few months with El Capitan, I can now report, with relatively conclusive evidence, that once again, Apple has proven incapable of introducing a new (and potentially useful) feature without introducing all kinds of new bugs at the same time. (Does this remind you of anyone?)
</p>
<p>
As soon as I upgraded my 2014 Mac Pro to El Capitan, I noticed the following problem. Occasionally, when waking my computer from sleep in the morning, I would be faced with a user environment <strong>with no mouse pointer anywhere on the screen</strong>. No amount of mouse shaking or fiddling with the keyboard (which seemed to work as expected) would bring it back. The only solution was to unplug the mouse (I still use a old, wired Apple “Magic Mouse”), wait a few seconds, and then plug it back in. Then the mouse pointer would finally magically reappear.
</p>
<p>
I upgraded to El Capitan back when the 10.11.3 update came out. We are now at 10.11.6 and nothing has changed. The problem still occurs from time to time. Of course, it can’t be reproduced reliably 100% of the time using a specific sequence of steps, so there’s basically no point in even trying to report the bug to Apple. Even if someone over there did care, they would never have the chance to devote time and resources to trying to reproduce the problem themselves and then doing something about it. It simply is not the way it works with Apple. Either you have a 100% reproducible scenario, preferably for a bug that affects lots of people, or you’re out of luck and trying to get the bug acknowledged and fixed is an exercice in futility.
</p>
<p>
Last week, several months after upgrading my own Mac, I took the time to upgrade my wife’s Mac, which is a 2006 Mac Pro tower — an old machine, I know, but one that has been upgraded with a faster video card and with a solid-state drive. That Mac Pro still works fine, and still supports the latest system, so we have little incentive to replace it with something more current. But… that also means that we are now more likely to encounter new bugs with more recent versions of the system that Apple doesn’t know anything about and doesn’t care about, because there are now too few users running the OS on such old machines, and because they probably don’t do any testing in-house whatsoever on such old machines themselves.
</p>
<p>
Guess what? As soon as I upgraded her Mac to El Capitan, I noticed <strong>another</strong> mouse-related problem.
</p>
<p>
On her Mac, the problem is the following. Every time the Mac Pro (the entire machine, not just the screen) goes to sleep, when I wake it up, things seem to be working OK, but then after a few seconds the mouse pointer freezes completely. The Mac continues to respond to keyboard input. (Application-switching with <kbd>command-Tab</kbd> still works, for example.) But the mouse pointer itself refuses to move, and some other UI events seem to be stuck. Then after twenty seconds or so, El Capitan snaps out of it, the mouse pointer starts responding to mouse movements again, and other UI events stuck in a queue (system beeps, notifications) are spurted out in rapid succession.
</p>
<p>
Things work fine after that, but whenever the Mac Pro is put to sleep, either manually via the Apple menu or because of its Energy Saver settings, the same problem occurs a few seconds after waking the machine from sleep.
</p>
<p>
This time, the problem is <strong>100% reproducible</strong>. I have even been able to reproduce it in a separate user environment with no customizations. So I could report it to Apple. But do I really think it’s worth the effort? I am far from convinced. Even if someone did pay attention to such a bug report, the likelihood of the bug getting fixed would be very small. (I’ve searched through the forums, and I haven’t found too many reports of the exact same problem. People have other freezing problems, but they are not temporary, and they don’t occur a few seconds after waking the Mac.)
</p>
<p>
So, what’s the solution? I can either ask my wife to get used to the 20-second delay every time the machine wakes from sleep, or I can change the Energy Saver settings so that the machine itself never goes to sleep. I can still get the screen to go to sleep and the hard drives to go to sleep, but I can set the Mac itself to “<span class="interfaceitem">Never</span>”. Of course, the environmentalist in me is not too happy about this, because it means more energy wasted for no reason (and also possibly a shorter lifespan for the machine). But what else can I do, really? I don’t get any sense that Apple really cares about such issues anymore (if they ever did).
</p>
<p>
The environmentalist in me is doubly annoyed these days, because my own 2014 Mac Pro also has a power-related problem in El Capitan. It now refuses to go to sleep altogether, even when I ask it to. It does go to some kind of semi-sleep, as evidenced by the fact that it stops checking for new mail after a while (even though I <strong>do have</strong> enabled Power Nap, for whatever that is worth), but the Mac itself never switches to the low-power mode with the pulsating light and zero fan noise. It stays on, and so does my external Thunderbolt enclosure of conventional hard drives in the basement.
</p>
<p>
This particular problem was introduced in the 10.11.5 update and is still there in 10.11.6. Earlier versions of El Capitan had no problem letting the Mac Pro go to sleep (and the Thunderbolt unit would automatically go to sleep itself after a few moments). I have reported the bug to Apple, and they have responded, by asking me if I can still reproduce the problem… in Developer Preview 3 of macOS Sierra! Really helpful… I guess there’s no hope of that one getting fixed any time soon either, then.
</p>
<p>
And up goes the wasteful power consumption in the Igot household thanks to Apple bugs…
</p>
<p>
I don’t believe this last bug has anything to do with the mouse, but I thought I’d mention it as yet another example of new, annoying bugs creeping up all the time in Apple software these days.
</p>
<p>
That is not all, however, as far as the mouse is concerned in El Capitan on my Mac Pro. By far the worst problem is another one, which I will attempt to describe now.
</p>
<p>
From time to time, seemingly out of the blue, the movements of the mouse pointer on my screen start getting jumpy. That’s the best way I can describe it. I move the mouse in a straight line, either dragging something along or just to click on something, and in the middle of the straight line, all of a sudden, the mouse pointer jumps to a different location on the screen.
</p>
<p>
It is very discombobulating and of course, causes me to make all kinds of errors, by clicking on the wrong target or dropping something in the wrong place. And it seems to be random.
</p>
<p>
I have been able to capture an example of the behaviour with <a href="http://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm">ScreenFlow</a>, which you can view in the following video clips. (The clips are in my Dropbox folder. You can preview them on the web or download them to play them on your desktop.)
</p>
<p>
To begin with, here’s a video clip of me dragging a window up and down in the Finder with smooth, responsive movements:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/alfocn0wfcoxttl/ElCapitan-NOTJumpy.mp4">ElCapitan-NOTJumpy.mp4</a>
</p>
<p>
Now here’s a nearly identical video clip, but this time with some “jumpiness” in the mouse movements:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ny54fa3inl6v7g2/ElCapitan-Jumpy.mp4"><br />
ElCapitan-Jumpy.mp4</a>
</p>
<p>
Hopefully you’ll notice the difference. In this particular clip, the jumps in question occur when going back up with the mouse.
</p>
<p>
This is just one particular example. The jumps are totally random and are sometimes much more significant, which makes it all the harder to keep track of the mouse pointer’s position.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, once this starts happening on my Mac Pro, the only way I have found to make it stop is to reboot the entire system — which, as you can imagine, is a major pain in the neck.
</p>
<p>
I haven’t really found much help through online searches. All I know is that the problem started occurring as soon as I upgraded to El Capitan. It cannot be a coincidence!
</p>
<p>
At some point, I suspected Bluetooth, but I don’t use any Bluetooth devices. Indeed, the upgrade to El Capitan, the system unilaterally reactivated Bluetooth on my Mac Pro, so I had to manually turn it off again. And for a while I didn’t have the jumpiness problem. But then it started happening again, even with Bluetooth off. So that wasn’t the culprit.
</p>
<p>
I am still investigating (and rebooting when I need to get work done). Right now I am experimenting with turning the “<span class="interfaceitem">Shake mouse pointer to locate</span>” option off altogether — even though I actually find it somewhat useful. (I have two large screens. Add to that the fact that Apple still has not fixed the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ac1r7dcch0mo4v5/ElCapitan-Cursor.mp4">on-going problem with the mouse pointer not changing reliably depending on the context</a>, as it’s supposed to, and you can easily end up with the wrong mouse pointer on a background that makes it very hard to see.)
</p>
<p>
Of course, I cannot say with 100% certainty that this new problem is directly linked to the introduction of the the “<span class="interfaceitem">Shake mouse pointer to locate</span>” option in El Capitan. But I cannot help but wonder… and despair, once more, of Apple ever getting its house in order and shipping an OS that actually fixes a whole whack of bugs without introducing a whole whack of new ones.

    <p>Earlier this month I was interviewed by Guy English and Rene Ritchie, hosts of the Debug podcast. We discussed: <a href="http://soundofftech.org">Sound Off</a>, the tech tinkering I did as a kid, how that led to a job at Apple, and being a developer in Apple's ecosystem who didn't grow up idolizing Jobs or Apple. I also got a chance to explain my process for putting together a talk. You can find the episode on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/debug/id578812394?mt=2">iTunes</a>.</p>

    <p>Last week I returned home from <a href="http://www.uikonf.com">UIKonf</a>, a conference I spoke at in Berlin, Germany. UIKonf is the first conference I've attended that provided live captioning for physically present attendees. In this context, live captioning meant that a large TV screen was on the side of the stage, with a scrolling real-time transcription of each talk. I knew before I arrived at UIKonf that there would be live captioning. In fact, my non-profit <a href="http://soundofftech.org">Sound Off</a>, raised over $3k in April to pay for it, contracting with <a href="http://www.whitecoatcaptioning.com">White Coat Captioning</a> to perform the transcription. That said, as an able-bodied person who never attended a conference with live captioning before, I didn't think I would notice a difference. Boy, was I naive.</p>

<p>At first, I enjoyed watching the captions scroll, or checking to see whether the words matched what the speaker said. Within hours, the live caption screen became an invaluable tool that I'd glance at several times during a talk. If there was a word I couldn't hear or a speaker had an accent I was having trouble understanding, I didn't have to resign myself to waiting for the video. No, I could simply glance at the screen and pick up the missing words. Similarly, if my attention drifted to the many items on my to-do list or I just <em>had</em> to check my phone and I stopped actively listening, the transcription always helped me get back into the context and flow of the talk.</p>

<p>Much to my delight, <a href="https://twitter.com/ranterle/status/734666422316617728">many</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/olebegemann/status/735133724992524289">attendees</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/agnoster/status/734656925024018436">also</a> noticed how awesome the live caption screen was, and felt that live captions were a helpful addition. I sincerely hope every conference I attend in the future has live captioning. It enriches the experience for in-person attendees, regardless of physical ability. In fact, when I'm invited to speak moving forward, I'll be asking organizers if they plan to provide live captioning.</p>

        • by Pierre Igot
      
      
    </p></div>
    <p>
In March, I wrote about <a href="https://www.betalogue.com/2016/03/18/el-capitan-upgrade/">my experience with OS X 10.11 (El Capitan)</a>, in relatively glowing terms. After <a href="https://www.betalogue.com/2015/04/15/os-x-10-10-3-responsiveness-issues/">my nightmarish experience with OS X 10.10 (Yosemite)</a>, the relatively smooth upgrade to El Capitan and the significant improvements in responsiveness were like a breath of fresh air. I even found long-standing bugs that were significant for me and that had finally been fixed…
</p>
<p>
Now that a few months have elapsed, however, I am afraid I need to revise my judgement somewhat. El Capitan is still a vast improvement over Yosemite, but I can now report that there are significant issues with OS X that were introduced several years ago (the consensus being that many of them first appeared in Lion) and are still not fixed in El Capitan.
</p>
<p>
First and foremost, there is still a major issue with <strong>keystrokes disappearing into the ether</strong>. I first reported on such a problem in OS X’s Mail <a href="https://www.betalogue.com/2012/02/03/lion-bugs/">back when Lion came out</a>, in 2012. Since then, in every single version of OS X that I have used, I have noticed the problem, not just in Mail, but in various other applications, both Apple applications and third-party applications. It is, of course, an intermittent problem that is, for the most part, impossible to reproduce reliably.
</p>
<p>
I recently wrote a post about <a href="https://www.betalogue.com/2016/03/26/el-capitan-finder-new-folder/">a particular scenario in OS X’s Finder</a> where I can reproduce the problem 100% reliably. But this is just a particular scenario. There are many other scenarios (composing messages in Mail, writing texts in Word 2016 or Nisus Writer Pro, etc.) where the problem with disappearing keystrokes occurs randomly and unpredictably. It’s like OS X suffers from responsiveness “hiccups”, and these hiccups are enough to cause it to lose track of what’s currently being typed by the user.
</p>
<p>
The feedback I got after writing that post was that it probably had something to do with OS X handling stuff “asynchronously”… I am afraid I don’t know enough about the innards of OS X to understand what’s going on here. All I know is that responsiveness problems in OS X are nothing new and that, in the past, as far as I can remember, OS X always seemed to have some kind of internal buffer that would prevent it from losing track of what was being typed. Yes, the flow of text being typed out would sometimes be interrupted by hiccups, but these hiccups wouldn’t actually cause OS X to lose keystrokes. They would be processed eventually, after the hiccups had passed.
</p>
<p>
Now, since Lion at least, OS X basically has hiccups that not only slow you down, but actually can cause some of your keystrokes to disappear altogether without bring processed. How is this acceptable?
</p>
<p>
As usual, problems in OS X manifest themselves in clusters, and there is no denying that the problem with lost keystrokes tends to be worse in applications that also have their own responsiveness issues, most notably in Word 2016. This effectively makes Word, an application that is already of very poor quality to begin with, even worse. The problem with vanishing keystrokes also tends to get worse overall when there are several background processes that are taking place, and actually slowing down the entire system for obvious (and understandable) reasons.
</p>
<p>
But let me be clear about this: The hiccups and the vanishing keystrokes can only happen in OS X even when there is no obvious reason for the system to become less responsive, even only temporarily. My system is complex enough that I cannot fully know, at any given time, exactly everything that is taking place, but I always keep an eye on CPU levels on my Mac, and the hiccups and the vanishing keystrokes can happen even when CPU levels are quite low and there is no apparent reason for my machine to experience a slow-down.
</p>
<p>
Worse still: The hiccups don&#8217;t just affect text entry. If a hiccup occurs while I am in the process of typing a sequence of keystrokes to execute a series of actions, i.e. a sequence of keyboard shortcuts in an application, it can actually affect the execution of the actions. And of course, unlike text entry, which is visible on the screen, missing keystrokes in sequences of keyboard shortcuts are not easy to spot. It can be rather maddening!
</p>
<p>
I find it rather sad that, in 2016, on a very powerful machine (a 2014 Mac Pro), I find myself having to monitor activity levels on a regular basis just in order to try and better understand why my system is not more responsive or in danger of losing some of my keystrokes, and adjust my own behaviour accordingly.
</p>
<p>
When exactly will Apple finally produce a computer that does not force fast users like me to wait or adjust their own speed? As I said, overall, El Capitan is indeed much more responsive than Yosemite, at least on my 2014 Mac Pro, with the same array of both Apple and third-party applications that I use on any given day. But it still isn’t as good as a system such as OS X Snow Leopard used to be, and one of the main reasons is that responsiveness issues (which have always been a fact of life in OS X) are now compounded by the very serious problem of randomly vanishing keystrokes.
</p>
<p>
I would probably be much more tolerant of hiccups if they didn’t cause keystrokes to disappear. I would be able to simply ignore the hiccups then. But as it is, I cannot help but notice them, because whenever they happen, there is a risk that I might lose keystrokes and have to retype, in part or in full, what I have just typed all over again.
</p>
<p>
Am I really the only one who’s bothered by this?
</p>
<p>
(Things can get even worse. From time to time, I experience a hiccup that is so bad that it causes the foreground application to somehow “seize up” completely when it comes to keyboard input. When that happens, even though the application itself remains responsive — I can still navigate its menus, dialog boxes, etc. — it refuses to process keyboard input, instead playing a system beep or doing nothing. When that happens, things don&#8217;t get back to normal by themselves. I have no choice but to quit and relaunch the application altogether. You won&#8217;t be surprised to hear that the application most often affected by this is Microsoft Word 2016, but I believe I remember experiencing the problem in other applications as well, even if it’s much rarer.)</p>

    <p><em>This article was originally published in Model View Culture's 2015 Quarterly No. 3</em></p>

<p>I recently participated in a panel on how to be an effective engineer for Code2040, a nonprofit organization striving to close the achievement gap by providing pathways for minorities to have successful careers in technology. The audience was a group of engineering interns, all from underrepresented backgrounds and working in the Bay Area for the summer. During the panel, I was asked to name something that has had the largest impact on my career success thus far. I said confidence, a response that was intentionally abstract.</p>

<p>Marginalized tech workers are often told they need to do more in order to achieve the successes of the majority or get the same treatment. Directives such as "Lean In!", "Negotiate!", "Network!", and "Find Mentors!" are preached heavily. It's as if doing one or all of these things will help make up for some sort of innate deficiency that is preventing marginalized tech workers from benefitting in a system the majority say is a meritocracy. Although this is a comforting fairy tale - because who doesn't want to believe that marginalized people are one behavioral adjustment from prosperity - it disregards the very nuanced privileges that enable majority people to be ambitious without fear of blowback. In other words, it's irresponsible to tell a marginalized person to apply a "one size fits all" strategy to their career. These strategies are recommended with good intentions, but without a clear blueprint or the acknowledgement that applying one may not yield the same benefit, most of this direction feels out of touch. Why is it always incumbent upon the marginalized to fix themselves in order to be treated with respect?</p>

<h3 id="whydoesconfidencematter">Why Does Confidence Matter?</h3>

<p>Our confidence is tested throughout life. It can be incredibly difficult to believe in yourself, and have unquantifiable knowledge of your worthiness when colleagues have low expectations of your technical abilities. Marianne Williamson's famous quote "...who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, and fabulous?" resonates. The tech field is a breeding ground for imposter syndrome. The more underrepresented you are, the larger the feeling you don't belong. </p>

<p>For marginalized tech workers, confidence doesn't manifest as projecting an ability to do something you can’t really do, or a lack of basic self-awareness. Marginalized people have plenty of self-awareness. We're constantly reminded at work that we exist on the fringe of the culture. Well-meaning colleagues invite us to opportunities based on our minority status, damaging our self-esteem and making us question our qualifications. As great as diversity in technology initiatives by companies can be, they also come dangerously close to insinuating that the very people they hope to attract are only there because “diversity.” Confidence for the marginalized looks a lot like simply believing you deserve a seat at the table, and have earned it through ability instead of filling a recruiting quota. </p>

<p>Subconsciously, confidence is the thread underlying your decision-making and behavior. Confident tech workers have an inner belief that they can learn, grow, and understand technical concepts. As a result, they approach difficult problems as a positive learning experience - regardless of outcome. Because they are secure in their abilities, confident tech workers don't worry about the optics of looking bad when they're wrong - so they readily admit mistakes. Being secure makes them unafraid to ask for help when needed. And when they do ask for help, confident tech workers expect to understand the explanation provided. In fact, they'll continue asking questions until they receive an explanation that makes sense to them. Confident tech workers know their ideas are worthwhile, so they speak to colleagues at a calm, relaxed pace. And most important, they recognize the tremendous value they bring to an organization - so they ensure a commensurate compensation. This is not the piece that tells marginalized tech workers to simply "be more confident," because I don't want to imply that it's easy. </p>

<h3 id="howhasconfidencebeenbuiltinmyownlife">How Has Confidence Been Built In My Own Life?</h3>

<p>I responded confidence to the panel prompt, because it has been the driving force behind my most important career decisions. Actually, it would be more correct to say that confidence has affected every single interaction - interpersonal or otherwise - that I've had at work. Unsurprisingly, I've been most effective as an engineer when I've believed in myself. After a few years of working at Apple, I knew I wanted the challenge of working with a small team of people focused on delivering a consumer-facing product. But self-doubt began to creep into my thoughts, and I questioned whether I was a strong enough engineer to be a meaningful contributor to a startup. Fortunately, I had a couple of experienced friends that believed I would be a great asset to a small team, in spite of the worrisome words coming out of my mouth. I respected each of them, so their encouragement forced me to believe in myself. </p>

<p>Surrounding myself with a great community of people has been one of the best assets to building my confidence. Whether you call them friends, partners, mentors, or coaches - it's imperative to have access to people that you can relate to, who believe in your abilities and allow you to lean on them for support. My support network helps me to recharge from the stresses of being a marginalized tech worker by allowing me to vent frustrations, express worries, and relax in their presence. When I feel the loneliness of being a marginalized tech worker, these individuals remind me that I'm not in uncharted territory. They also serve the important role of helping to rebuild my confidence in those destructive moments of self-doubt. Knowing that I have their support and advice helps me feel a sense of security.</p>

<p>Another way that I've helped to build my confidence is by adopting a growth mindset. Recognizing that engineering is a skill and therefore one that I can improve upon is a relatively new mindset shift for me. My introduction to programming started with the book "C++ in 21 Days" when I was in 6th grade. Being the type-A kid that I was, I decided that I was going to learn C++ in exactly 21 days. Though I had no idea what C++ was, I was doing a good job learning it until I got to "Day 8" - pointers. Up to that point in my life, school was easy. Yet here was this book with concepts in it that felt like a brick wall preventing me from moving on to the next day! I began to feel like I didn't possess the natural talent to excel as a programmer. </p>

<p>Years later, when I did well in programming classes in high school and college, a part of me was dismissive of those results. Because of that initial experience programming, I was subconsciously held back by the fear of finding another brick wall concept that I wouldn't be able to grasp. It's taken a decade to reverse this thinking and stop having a fixed mindset about my engineering abilities, but it's been worth the effort. Now, because I believe that I can grow as an engineer, I'm motivated to invest in myself. The intrinsic belief that I can get better keeps me confidently striving in my career for more responsibility and new challenges.</p>

<p>After the initial panic that comes with taking on a new professional challenge, I deal with the accompanying stress, anxiety, and self-doubt by managing the one thing in my control - my preparation. In October 2014, I did my first technical talk in Moscow, Russia. Though the opportunity terrified me and had me questioning everything, including whether I was qualified to give the talk and whether the audience would listen to a marginalized tech worker - I knew it was something I needed to try. To cope with the self-doubt, I made sure that the delivery of my content was as good as possible by practicing relentlessly. Knowing that I had all thirty-five minutes of my talk memorized gave me the personal internal comfort that I could handle some of the possible failure scenarios in my head. When it did come time to present, one of those failure scenarios actually manifested. The large in-stage monitor with my presentation notes flickered in and out before turning off for long periods of time. But because I had over-prepared, I was able to calmly hide this technical glitch from the audience and deliver my talk as rehearsed.</p>

<p>Finally, it's important to recognize the importance of scheduling time for yourself, to do things you enjoy outside of work. I know that I feel my best and most confident when I stay active, so I foster habits like eating healthy and working out. I've noticed that setting and diligently pursuing my personal training milestones gives me the feeling that I can similarly pursue and accomplish my professional goals. In short, doing things outside of work that make you feel better, can actually make you feel better about work. Figure out what brings you joy and makes you feel good about yourself, then set aside time, and go do those activities. </p>

<h3 id="howcanyoubuildtheconfidenceofthosearoundyou">How Can You Build the Confidence of Those Around You?</h3>

<p>The culture at work plays a significant role in the confidence of marginalized tech workers. I have worked in environments before where I felt like I couldn't be wrong or admit that I wasn't familiar with a technical concept because of the physical displays of dismissiveness, like deep sighing, I received from my bosses. I've also felt as though I had a very limited number of mistakes that I could make before people stopped respecting my professional technical opinion. And I knew that I had exceeded the number of allowed mistakes when I began to get undermined constantly. Instead of respecting my opinion, my bosses would ask me to validate my conclusions by seeking out the professional opinions of majority tech workers in their network. This combination of low expectations for technical ability, and constant second-guessing creates toxic, unwelcoming environments. </p>

<p>Afford marginalized colleagues the same respect given to majority workers by default. Assume your co-workers from underrepresented backgrounds possess domain expertise in the roles they were hired to fill. Be more supportive friends and colleagues by being open to their feedback, and believing their experiences. Acknowledge the additional stress and cognitive overhead that your colleagues may be experiencing because they're underrepresented, and ask how they could feel more welcome at work.</p>

<p>Finally, avoid inviting marginalized colleagues to partake in an opportunity because of their minority status. I understand that these invitations are well-intentioned, but saying "we need more of (your marginalized group), would you like to attend?" is not only lazy, it's offensive. That message has done two things. It's reduced the invitee to feeling like they don't have any qualifications beyond being from an underrepresented background, and it's put a burden on their choice of whether to accept. If the opportunity is worthwhile, the marginalized tech worker will struggle with whether to accept and deal with the guilt of feeling like they received an undeserved benefit, or decline an otherwise good career move. Instead of leading an event invitation with a mention of how the invitee will improve the diversity of the lineup, why not mention all of the great work that person has done to get themselves noticed in the first place. Yes, marginalized tech workers are from underrepresented backgrounds - but stop making this the focus of the pitch.</p>

<p class="ornaments">P</p>

<p>There is no one thing that can be done to make the industry better for marginalized tech workers, but by cultivating a supportive network, adopting a growth mindset, focusing on preparation, and taking care of ourselves outside of work, we have a better chance of confidently facing the challenges ahead.</p>

I love that Sound Off works to increase the access marginalized people in tech have to professional opportunities. It's a natural fit for my interests and something I'm just as passionate about.</p>

<p>Sound Off's second campaign is happening now. We're fundraising to provide live captioning for UIKonf, "an independent conference in Berlin, Germany focusing on iOS development. Live captioning for UIKonf is not only going to open up the conference to the deaf community and the hard of hearing, but will be indispensable for many of the attendees for whom English is not their first language." </p>

    <p>When I left Dropbox, I said I wanted to focus on building products from scratch. That desire hasn't changed, but my anticipated venue has. Startups pivot. Business models and priorities change quickly, seemingly overnight. When paths diverge and there are two different goals, it doesn't make sense to move forward just for the sake of appearances.</p>

<p>Right now, I'm remote contracting for the first time in my career. I like the freedom of managing my own schedule, and making sure I fit in time for the gym and reading. Most of all, I'm enjoying ramping up on Swift by working on apps with real deadlines. If you need a contract iOS engineer, please reach out.</p>

<p>The most exciting news I have to share is that I'm in the beginning stages of a new project with a very talented designer friend of mine. We've been interested in working together for a while and the timing is perfect. As the project matures, I look forward to charting our technical progress on this blog.</p>

<p>The biggest lesson I've learned since leaving Dropbox is that I don't need to wait until I gain this or that experience, I'm ready to start my own venture right now.</p>

    <p>
Last week, I wrote about how pleased I was with <a href="https://www.betalogue.com/2016/03/18/el-capitan-upgrade/">my upgrade from Yosemite to El Capitan</a>.
</p>
<p>
I am still pleased, but daily use of El Capitan is starting to reveal things that I hadn’t noticed in my first few days of playing with the new OS.
</p>
<p>
As I noted in my post, I am a fast user. Yosemite was very frustrating because of all kinds of small responsiveness issues that caused it to experience “hiccups” and to fail to register some of my keystrokes or mouse clicks if I went “too fast” for it.
</p>
<p>
El Capitan’s responsiveness is much better. However, it’s not perfect. And I have a very simple example of a very common situation where, like its immediate predecessor, it fails miserably.
</p>
<p>
In OS X’s Finder, when I want to create a new folder, I tend to use the keyboard shortcut, i.e. <kbd>command-shift-N</kbd>. This is supposed to create the new folder and then make its default name (“<span class="passage">untitled folder</span>”) editable and highlighted, so that I can start typing the new name over the default name right away.
</p>
<p>
The key problem here is what “right away” actually means. In my mind, it means what it means in everyday English, i.e. <strong>without any delay</strong>.
</p>
<p>
In OS X 10.11, however, it means something else. It means “very soon after pressing <kbd>command-shift-N</kbd>, provided you give OS X a little time to recover from the tremendous strain of having to create a new folder and make its name editable and highlighted”.
</p>
<p>
In practical terms, it means that, after I press <kbd>command-shift-N</kbd> on my machine (a 2014 Mac Pro with 32 GB of RAM, with a 1 TB SSD as the startup volume), I cannot start typing the name right away. I have to wait for a fraction of a second before I do so. If I don’t, then the first couple of letters I type fail to appear in the folder name that I typed.
</p>
<p>
Yes, you read this right: I, Pierre Igot, am a supernaturally fast typist, with whom a powerful machine such as the 2014 Mac Pro is not able to keep up.
</p>
<p>
I am joking, of course. There’s nothing supernatural about my typing, and I am quite sure the Mac Pro itself is not at fault. The problem is, as usual, <strong>with Apple’s software</strong> and, in this particular case, with El Capitan’s Finder.
</p>
<p>
I’ve actually created a very simple <a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/">Keyboard Maestro</a> macro to reproduce the problem:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="ElCapitan-Finder-NewFolder1" height="312" src="https://www.betalogue.com/images/uploads/finder/ElCapitan-Finder-NewFolder1.png" width="461" />
</p>
<p>
This macro does exact the same thing I do when I create a folder and type its name (“<span class="filename">My new folder name</span>” in this example), except, of course, that the macro is executed by the Keyboard Maestro engine, which is much faster than I, lowly human, can ever hope to be.
</p>
<p>
And guess what? El Capitan’s Finder <strong>completely fails to record the entire typed text</strong>. When I execute this macro on my Mac Pro, all I get is a new folder titled “<span class="filename">untitled folder</span>”. There’s no sign of the typed text (“My new folder name”) that the macro has input as typed text.
</p>
<p>
After experimenting a bit, I have found that, in order for El Capitan’s Finder not to ignore the typed text, there needs to be a pause of <strong>at least 0.3 second</strong> between the first step (the creating of the folder) and the second step (the typing of the folder name):
</p>
<p>
<img alt="ElCapitan-Finder-NewFolder2" height="312" src="https://www.betalogue.com/images/uploads/finder/ElCapitan-Finder-NewFolder2.png" width="461" />
</p>
<p>
With that pause, everything works fine. If I only put a pause of 0.2 second, I get a folder with the truncated name “<span class="filename">older name</span>”. And if I only put a pause of 0.1 second, I get… nothing.
</p>
<p>
Of course, my own human hands are totally incapable of typing this fast, and in reality, when I execute these steps manually in El Capitan’s Finder, the worst that happens to me is that I am missing <strong>the very first letter</strong> of the name that I typed. But it happens often enough that it is very frustrating, especially since I only notice it once I’ve typed the rest of the name, and so I have to backtrack and edit the name manually in order to restore the missing letter at the beginning of the folder name.
</p>
<p>
What is really unbelievable to me here is not so much that the Finder needs a fraction of a second after creating the folder. It is that there does not seem to be any kind of <strong>text input buffer that keeps my keystrokes in memory</strong> until the OS is ready to process them. The keystroke(s) that the Finder fails to register simply disappear into the ether, as if the characters had never been typed.
</p>
<p>
How on earth is this acceptable in a modern operating system? It’s one thing to have speed/responsiveness issues. It’s quite another to fail to include standard features such as a keyboard buffer in order to minimize the impact of such issues on the actual usability of the software.
</p>
<p>
Last week, I was tempted to call El Capitan the best OS X release in a long time. It still is way better than Yosemite, and probably also better than Mavericks, Mountain Lion, and Lion. But beyond that? I don’t remember having basic keyboard buffer issues in the old days of OS X. What the hell is going at Apple? In the rush to add new features and simplify computing for the masses, have they somehow completely forgotten the basics?
</p>
<p>
Two words, Apple: Keyboard. Buffer.
</p>
<p>
It is <strong>that</strong> simple.
</p>
<p>

    <p>
I haven’t written on this blog since last year and my <a href="https://www.betalogue.com/2015/04/15/os-x-10-10-3-responsiveness-issues/">very traumatic experience</a> with upgrading my 2014 Mac Pro to OS X 10.10 (Yosemite).
</p>
<p>
It’s not that I don’t have anything more to say about OS X or other topics. It’s just that I find it less time-consuming and more immediate to post things on <a href="https://twitter.com/betalogue">Twitter</a>, in spite of the limitations of the medium.
</p>
<p>
I also have been feeling rather discouraged about the whole computing thing. It’s something that’s been building up for years. From my <a href="https://www.betalogue.com/2003/05/02/apple-peel-power-mac-g4-mdd-the-noise-issue-and-apples-solution/">atrociously noisy Power Mac G4 MDD</a> to my Faraday-cage PowerBook G4 that couldn’t get a wireless signal to the <a href="https://www.betalogue.com/2006/06/04/macbook-the-mooing-noise-disaster/">mooing MacBook disaster</a> to my <a href="https://www.betalogue.com/2006/11/20/dead-g5-quad-end-of-the-saga/">kernel-panicking Power Mac G5</a> to the seemingly never-ending list of long-standing bugs in Apple’s software and its general untrustworthiness as a purveyor of quality, reliable productivity software (hello, <a href="https://www.betalogue.com/2013/10/24/pages-5-disaster/">Pages 5</a>), I can’t help but feel that the number of on-going problems with my computing setup outweighs whatever enthusiasm I might still have in me about technology in general and computing with Apple products in particular.
</p>
<p>
And so the reserves of energy and time that I am willing to devote to writing about these things have become somewhat depleted.
</p>
<p>
That being said, unlike some people, I cannot stay behind the times for very long. There’s just no way that I can continue to work and play with an operating system that is several years old and no longer updated.
</p>
<p>
After the trauma of my experience with Yosemite, you won’t be surprised to hear that I decided to take my own sweet time with the upgrade to El Capitan. With Yosemite, I had waited until the official release of OS X 10.10.1 before upgrading from Mountain Lion. And it’s only when OS X 10.10.3 came out, several months later, than my major responsiveness issues with the Mac Pro were finally resolved. So I decided to wait until at least OS X 10.11.3 before upgrading to El Capitan.
</p>
<p>
Don’t get me wrong. It’s not that I was happy with my Yosemite-based system. While the major responsiveness issues were solved by the OS X 10.10.3 update, there were still many less obvious, but still extremely irritating responsiveness issues that were never fixed in Yosemite, even with the release of the OS X 10.10.5 update (the latest available). And there were, of course, a number of other bugs that were quite annoying to live with, not to mention the very questionable choice of Helvetica Neue as the system font.
</p>
<p>
Apple touted El Capitan as primarily a “bug fix” release, even though, of course, its marketing material focused on yet more <a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/">new features</a> — most of which held little interest for me (except for the promise of “<span class="passage">across-the-board acceleration</span>” and a Mac that would “<span class="passage">feel more fluid and responsive</span>”).
</p>
<p>
However, after the initial release of El Capitan, I saw a number of reports online on yet more new bugs introduced by this latest OS. Of course, it’s always difficult to get a proper sense of how bad things really are when you read about other people’s experiences online. But several specific things that people reported about El Capitan made me quite worried, and conforted me in my choice to wait things out.
</p>
<p>
Finally, a week ago, I completed a big project that had kept me busy for a whole month, and I decided that my “reward” for completing it would be to take some time to install El Capitan. At that stage, OS X 10.11.3 was officially out and AppleSeed had already released several iterations of the 10.11.4 update, so I thought it was a reasonable time to give it a try.
</p>
<h3>Responsiveness and Fluidity</h3>
<p>
I took all the usual precautions, of course, and made sure that I could easily fall back on my Yosemite-based setup if things turned out to be disastrous again, as they were with OS X 10.10.1 for me back in December 2014. I also made sure that all my third-party software was perfectly up-to-date.
</p>
<p>
And then I took the plunge. The upgrading process itself was rather worrisome, because there were long periods of time where nothing (absolutely nothing) was happening on the screen and I was really worried about the upgrade process having become stuck. (The progress bars and status messages were, on the whole, pretty much useless on my machine.) Thankfully, I managed to be patient enough to ignore those worrying signs and wait it out, and finally, after something like 90 minutes, the upgrade sorted itself out and I was back up and running.
</p>
<p>
My initial impression was fairly positive. There were only a few relatively minor glitches. There were no new obvious “big bugs” that might have been deal-breakers or at the very least very painful problems to have to live with for a while. And the whole system did indeed feel significantly more fluid and responsive on my Mac Pro than Yosemite ever did.
</p>
<p>
Now, a week later, I can confirm that there are indeed significant improvements in that department. I am afraid that, in Yosemite, Apple really got too far ahead of itself in the revamp of OS X’s UI and built something that was far from optimized for a setup such as mine (i.e. a 2014 Mac Pro with two monitors, a conventional 30” Apple Cinema display and a more recent 4K Sharp display), especially when it came to graphics acceleration and overall visual fluidity. There were far too many unpleasant “hiccups” in the Yosemite UI to which I — as a user who tends to work very fast (fast typing, fast use of the mouse and keyboard shortcuts) and uses several tools to automate a large number of tasks — was far too sensitive. Those hiccups were impossible to get used to for me, and were one of the main reasons why, in the end, I was quite anxious to upgrade to El Capitan and see if it wasn’t “all in my head”, and if Apple had indeed taken the task of making the OS more responsive for users like me seriously enough.
</p>
<p>
El Capitan is decidedly more fluid than Yosemite. Most of the hiccups that would be so annoying to me in Yosemite are gone. There is still the occasional noticeable delay in this or that, but not often enough to be a significant annoyance for me. I no longer notice times when the OS takes a fraction of a second to draw a menu after I’ve clicked on its heading, for example. (The weird way that OS X draws the blue highlighting for the “<span class="menuheading">Help</span>” menu heading, which I noticed first in Yosemite, is still there in El Capitan, however, but I don’t use that menu — which is rarely all that helpful — often enough to really be bothered by it.) And I no longer notice hiccups when dialog sheets (like the “<span class="interfaceitem">Save As…</span>” dialog) drop out of window title bars.
</p>
<p>
In fact, El Capitan’s responsiveness improvements are such that they have made even using this horrible kludge of a piece of software called Microsoft Word 2016 (something that I cannot escape in my line of work) not as painful as it was in Yosemite. Word 2016 is still a horrible application and it still has all kinds of responsiveness issues of its own, but at least they are no longer compounded by OS X’s own responsiveness issues, which means that they are somewhat more tolerable (but still unacceptable, of course).
</p>
<p>
(Another obvious change in Word 2016 in El Capitan is that now, when I open a Word document from the Finder, Word first displays a <strong>big black rectangle</strong>, and <em>then</em> fills it with the document window. It’s rather unsightly, although, of course, quite harmless, and only lasts for a fraction of a second. Microsoft has never had any shame about such subpar finish in its software, so I don’t expect that this purely cosmestic issue will be fixed any time soon.)
</p>
<p>
Even more important, the problem with keystrokes occasionally <em>disappearing in the ether</em> (instead of being buffered, and eventually properly processed) because of responsiveness issues with OS X seems to be gone, or at least greatly reduced. (It’s hard to reproduce such an intermittent problem.)
</p>
<p>
I was also pleasantly surprised by how few <a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/">Keyboard Maestro</a> macros I had to update after upgrading to El Capitan. My experience with the upgrade to Yosemite had been that several macros needed to be adjusted because of responsiveness issues and other changes and glitches. In El Capitan, I only had to make one significant change, to my <a href="https://twitter.com/betalogue/status/568065525013733376">macro for sending messages in Mail</a> (which automatically adjusts font size for rich text messages), because Apple changed something in in the GUI scripting architecture (via System Events) for that application.
</p>
<h3>Mail</h3>
<p>
In fact, OS X Mail was one of my main areas of concern for the upgrade to El Capitan, because I had read reports about new bugs in the application, and I rely on it too much to be able to live with too many bugs. Fortunately, while many of Mail’s existing, long-standing bugs still aren’t fixed in El Capitan, I have yet to encounter any significant new bugs that really affect me in my use of it. The only notable ones so far are the following.
</p>
<p>
Mail loses the focus on the file list when I use the “<span class="interfaceitem">Attach Files</span>” dialog box to add attachments to a message that I am composing and when I take the extra step of Quick-Looking the files to check them before attaching them (a reasonable enough habit, I believe!). But I’ve submitted a <a href="http://openradar.appspot.com/25165731">bug report</a> about it, and Apple has already responded by closing it as a duplicate, so the early signs are encouraging.
</p>
<p>
Also, there is a significant problem with the toolbar in the window for composing messages. Unlike toolbars elsewhere in Mail, this toolbar no longer displays the text labels under the button icons, and the option to force the toolbar to display these text labels is gone from the “<span class="interfaceitem">Customize Toolbar…</span>” dialog sheet:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.betalogue.com/images/uploads/mail/mail-send-toolbar1.png" target="_blank" title="Click to see full-size image."><img alt="mail-send-toolbar1" height="76" src="https://www.betalogue.com/images/uploads/mail/mail-send-toolbar1.png" width="488" /></a>
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.betalogue.com/images/uploads/mail/mail-send-toolbar2.png" target="_blank" title="Click to see full-size image."><img alt="mail-send-toolbar2" height="212" src="https://www.betalogue.com/images/uploads/mail/mail-send-toolbar2.png" width="386" /></a>
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.betalogue.com/images/uploads/mail/mail-send-toolbar3.png" target="_blank" title="Click to see full-size image."><img alt="mail-send-toolbar3" height="240" src="https://www.betalogue.com/images/uploads/mail/mail-send-toolbar3.png" width="419" /></a>
</p>
<p>
I hope that this is a bug that was introduced accidentally, and that it’s going to be fixed soon, because it’s kind of annoying, even for someone like me who pretty much knows what each button icon means. I still rely of the text labels as well for faster targeting.
</p>
<p>
One other noticeable change (for me) is that the information provided in Mail’s “<span class="interfaceitem">Activity</span>” window is now much more limited, to the point of being almost useless. I’ve always relied on that window to get a better sense of what was going on behind the scenes in Mail, especially when my bandwidth was much more limited than it is today. When things work fine, I don’t really need it, of course. But I don’t know what’s going to happen the next time I start having some serious problem with a mail server. (Also, Mail no longer has an optional pane for a more summary display of its background activities at the bottom of the mailbox list. Instead, it just displays a small status line from time to time at the bottom, <em>on top of the list</em>, whether you want it or not.)
</p>
<p>
I still find it rather irritating to have to deal with Mail’s very clumsy and buggy mechanism for removing attachments from messages before archiving them. The problems introduced in Yosemite (especially when removing attachments from emails in discussion threads, a.k.a. “conversations”) are still there in El Capitan, and the even older problems haven’t been addressed either. There has been absolutely no progress on that front, even though removing attachments is an important tool in order to try and keep the total size of one’s email archive reasonably low. (Mine currently weighs over 2 GB. I hate to think what it would weigh if I had left all these attachments in the messages when archiving them.)
</p>
<p>
And Mail’s text rendering engine still gleefully treats non-breaking spaces as regular, breakable spaces, which is quite problematic in French typography (although there’s probably no one at Cupertino who really cares about this).
</p>
<p>
On a positive note, however, Mail no longer freezes for 20 seconds every time I try to access the “<span class="interfaceitem">Accounts</span>” pane in its “<span class="interfaceitem">Preferences</span>” dialog, which I am quite relieved about. Also, the long-standing issue that I had with Mail <a href="https://www.betalogue.com/2012/11/13/lionmail-removeattachmentsfix/">failing to flag my sent messages as having attachments</a> (when they did contain attachments) and therefore preventing me from removing said attachments (because it didn’t see them) appears to be gone.
</p>
<p>
And Apple has even fixed the <a href="https://www.betalogue.com/2012/09/20/lion-selectionhighlighting/">long-standing bug with selection highlighting in Mail</a> when it was hidden by the “<span class="menuitem">Hide Others</span>” menu command while in the background. It still took them <strong>five bloody years</strong> to fix it, but at least it’s finally gone (as is the similar selection-highlighting problem in various other applications that I use, especially stand-alone, site-specific Safari-based web browsers created using <a href="http://fluidapp.com">Fluid</a>).
</p>
<h3>Other OS X Applications</h3>
<p>
In other OS X applications, some long-standing problems remain, such as <a href="https://www.betalogue.com/2015/03/09/yosemite-preview-window-resizing-continued/">Preview’s inability to keep up with very fast window resizing</a> (especially problematic if you use <a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/">Keyboard Maestro</a> macros to resize your windows).
</p>
<p>
The Finder still suffers from that annoying glitch where OS X fails to invert the text of the folder name when dragging a file onto a folder in a background window:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="ScreenFlowSnapz002" height="445" src="https://www.betalogue.com/images/uploads/finder/ScreenFlowSnapz002.png" width="438" />
</p>
<p>
(And I’ve also already encountered the glitch where the Finder fails to highlight the target of a drag-and-drop altogether, so that’s not completely fixed either.)
</p>
<p>
Apple has changed something in the system that causes the font smoothing in Numbers 3.6 to be somewhat better for <em>some</em> fonts (Helvetican Neue, for one), but it <em>still</em> does not use subpixel antialiasing like it does in another applications, at least on my computer:
</p>
<p>

Spotlight still fails to automatically index new “<span class="filename">.docx</span>” documents that I add to my system (whether by creating them from scratch or by saving them as attachments from email messages), which is rather annoying. I was hoping that this was going to be fixed in El Capitan, because the last response I got from Bug Reporter about this problem last year (when I was still running Yosemite) was a request to confirm whether the problem was fixed in… the latest build of El Capitan at the time, which of course was very unhelpful, because there was no way I was going to upgrade to El Capitan back then (which was still then in beta form), just in order to check if this particular bug was fixed.
</p>
<p>
I gave up on Spotlight as a serious search tool long ago, and tend to rely on the (rather expensive, but effective and reliable) FoxTrot Professional Search application by <a href="http://www.ctmdev.com">CTM Development</a> for my searches, but the chronic failure to automatically index new “<span class="filename">.docx</span>” documents is still an annoyance.
</p>
<p>
I actually ended up following the advice in <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7368240?tstart=0">this thread at Apple Discussions</a> (I am obviously not the only one with this problem) to create a Terminal command for forcing Spotlight to index new “<span class="filename">.docx</span>” documents, and using <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/cronnix/">CronniX</a> to add this command to my system as a task to be <a href="https://twitter.com/betalogue/status/709823522370142208">automatically executed every day</a>.
</p>
<p>
But really, should I, as a Mac user, really have to go to such lengths to work around <em>your</em> problems, Apple?
</p>
<p>
Another thing that I was looking forward to in El Capitan is the ability to shake the mouse to magnify the cursor, when I lose track of it on my large screens… It works, but it doesn’t work as well as I had hoped. I occasionally get cursor magnification during regular mouse movements, when I don’t want or need it, and when I do want the magnification, I find that the amount of shaking required is a bit excessive. I hope the feature will be fine-tuned in the future. (It might work better with a wireless mouse, but I still use the wired Apple Mouse.)
</p>
<p>
Sadly, the problem with OS X failing to change the mouse cursor reliably based on the context, which was introduced in Yosemite, is also still there in El Capitan. This problem is brilliantly illustrated by <a href="https://twitter.com/eli_schiff/status/686590671864516608">Eli Schiff</a> in a YouTube video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L53gr0jL8YM">here</a>. (The video was made with Yosemite, but as far as I can tell the problem still exists in El Capitan.)
</p>
<p>
The new San Francisco system font is indeed much nicer than Helvetica Neue, and we should never have had to live with Helvetica Neue for a year (and I really feel for those who are obliged, for whatever reason, to stick with Yosemite). Like other commentators, however, I do find that the <a href="http://mjtsai.com/blog/2015/09/23/san-francisco-quotation-marks/">lack of distinction between the opening and the closing single quotes and double quotes</a> is quite problematic.
</p>
<p>
The problems with OS X’s architecture for “resuming” applications (i.e. reopening the windows that were left open when the application was last quit) are still there in El Capitan. TextEdit still seems unable to resume properly after a system restart, and I’ve already had an incident where I accidentally interrupted a system restart triggered by a software update and, after manually triggering the restart myself, I ended up with a complete failure of the resume feature in the Finder, which meant that I had to reopen all my Finder windows and tabs manually.
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
That’s about all that I can say for now, after one week. Overall, I am quite pleased with having upgraded to El Capitan. The singlemost important improvement for me is the responsiveness and fluidity of the UI. It’s not perfect, but it is much, much better than it was with Yosemite on the same hardware. The upgrade is worth it just for that.
</p>
<p>
I am also quite pleased to find that Apple has indeed fixed some long-standing bugs that had been a daily annoyance for me for years. I can actually now eliminate some of my <a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/">Keyboard Maestro</a> macros, because they are no longer needed to work around those bugs.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, there are still many issues that remain unaddressed, in Mail and in other OS X applications, which make the upgrade less impressive as a “bug-fixing” release than I had hoped it would be. Given that Apple’s recent history indicates that no significant additional bug fixes will come in subsequent incremental updates for El Capitan (other than for bugs introduced in El Capitan itself), and that the next version of OS X might not have as much a focus on bug fixing as this one, I fear that I might have to continue to live with those remaining annoyances for many more years.
</p>
<p>
El Capitan does not significantly alter my current feelings about computing in general. Sure, it’s not as painful to use as Yosemite was, but it’s still far from being as polished as I’d like it to be, as some of the problems highlighted above demonstrate.
</p>
<p>
Will the next version of OS X be another step forward or a new step back? Time will tell… But if you haven’t upgraded to El Capitan yet and needed to know more about what it brings, I hope that the above addresses at least some of your questions and concerns.</p>

    <p>Late last year I finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Steve-Jobs-Evolution-Visionary/dp/0385347405">Becoming Steve Jobs</a>, the unauthorized biography of Steve Jobs, written by Brent Schlender and Rick Tetzeli. For those keeping track of Jobs biographies, this was the book publicly endorsed by current Apple leadership, with input from Jobs' widow, Laurene Powell Jobs, and his closest friends. Though there are two authors, the narrative is written from the perspective of Schlender, who lends credibility to the book with his twenty-five year professional and at times personal relationship with Jobs. Admittedly, I never got around to reading the official biography by Walter Isaacson, partly because enough people I respected decried the book and it's author for not understanding Jobs' technological achievements. With Schlender, I didn't have those same concerns, because he spent his career covering Jobs as a tech writer for the Wall Street Journal and Fortune.</p>

<p>I wasn't particularly interested in Apple growing up. In fact, I didn't own my first Mac until after I interned at Apple. For someone like me, who was too young to have witnessed or wasn't paying attention to most of Jobs' career, it's easy to lionize Jobs. It's easy to view Jobs as this fully-formed genius, who was born with the right tools to achieve greatness. As <em>Becoming Steve Jobs</em> shows, this was not at all the case. Jobs matured into the innovative leader he's remembered as, through trial and error. He failed, a lot. But he never allowed those failures to cause him to question his own judgement. Too often, instead of listening to my gut and inner voice, I seek the opinions of others to validate my decisions. One of the things I admire about Jobs is how strongly he believed in himself.</p>

<p>Jobs' ouster from Apple is depicted as the best thing to have happened to his career. I expected the narrative to focus on Jobs founding NeXT and how that led to his triumphant return to Apple. But the authors don't look favorably on this venture. At NeXT we see that Jobs is making the same mistakes that marked the end of his first stint at Apple, building an unfocused product without a market. Instead, the authors credit Jobs' purchase of Pixar as having taught him to be a great leader. It's at Pixar that Jobs learns how to manage creative people, through his friendships with Ed Catmull<sup id="ref1"><a href="http://ashleynh.me:80/becoming-steve-jobs/#fn1">1</a></sup>, President, and John Lassetter, Chief Creative Officer. Sure, Jobs had the foresight to purchase Pixar, and not give up on the company. He also negotiated Disney's acquisition of Pixar to secure its future. Largely though, credit is given to Catmull for effectively managing Jobs into allowing Pixar to operate autonomously. Providing these depictions and insights is where the book shines.</p>

<p>That said, I have a few criticisms. Contributions from those who best knew Jobs vary in effectiveness. When used to bring the narrative to life, the resulting exposition is among the best the book has to offer. My favorite chapter, for example, tells the story of the day Jobs delivered his great commencement speech at Stanford University, from the perspective of Laurene. I don't want to spoil the story, but it's funny, highlights a lesser-known side of Jobs, and reflects the level of effort he gave to his work. Similarly, Eddy Cue and Jony Ive's anecdotes about their first days working with Jobs are enjoyable to read. </p>

<p>In contrast, Tim Cook's quotes have an agenda that feels out of place. Cook uses the book as a platform to defend his friend against Isaacson's portrayal. In fact, there are two full pages of consecutive quotes that read like a soliloquy, without narrative structure. A curious moment also occurs when Cook explains Jobs' part in the lawsuit against Silicon Valley companies, for their secret and illegal agreement not to poach senior employees from one another. Cook says in part "...I don't think he was thinking about saving any money. He was just very protective of his employees." I was surprised to hear such a patriarchal sentiment from the CEO of Apple. I get that he's defending his friend, but Jobs' actions were illegal, so the defense comes off tone-deaf.</p>

<p>I also thought some of Jobs' flaws were glossed over. A single page was devoted to the strained relationship Jobs had with his first daughter Lisa, after initially denying paternity. Given what I already knew, and the book's admission that "when people debate whether Steve was a 'good' or 'bad' man, this is the strongest indictment against him," I expected more insight to be provided.</p>

<p>Finally, the pronoun "he" is used throughout the book to describe a hypothetical person or the reader. I greatly prefer when authors choose to evenly switch between pronouns. The singular use of "he" took me out of the reading, like a constant reminder that I'm not a part of the intended audience for the book.</p>

<p>Overall, I enjoyed reading <em>Becoming Steve Jobs</em>. In Silicon Valley, successful young co-founders are put on a pedestal, which makes it easy to view these people as born leaders. By his 20s, Jobs' early success made him a celebrity, but in the book we find out that he wasn't a great leader until his return to Apple in his 40s. A thread of growth connects the book from beginning to end. And so now I view Jobs less like a folklore hero, and more like a deeply flawed person who became a visionary leader.</p>

    <p>I recently shattered the screen of my iPhone 6S. Since then, every Apple fan I've spoken with has asked me if I have AppleCare+, and each has given me the same pitying look of sympathy when I say no. "You should really get that," they say. Well, today I looked at the numbers and I still don't see a point to Apple's warranty program for iPhones.</p>

<p>AppleCare+ can be purchased for an iPhone 6S at $129. With it, comes discounted pricing for two<sup id="ref1"><a href="http://ashleynh.me:80/applecare-plus/#fn1">1</a></sup> incidents of accidental damage. An iPhone 6S screen repair, for example, costs $99 on AppleCare+ and $129 without. </p>

<p>Had I purchased AppleCare+, my screen repair would have been $228<sup id="ref2"><a href="http://ashleynh.me:80/applecare-plus/#fn2">2</a></sup>, instead of $129. If I were to damage my phone's screen a second time, yes that would cost me $99 on AppleCare+. But that's $99 on top of the $228 I've already paid, or $327. Without AppleCare+, the same two screen repairs cost $258.</p>

<p>AppleCare+ only starts to make fiscal sense when you need to replace the entire phone. At that point, it costs the same $228 for the first incident, instead of $299 without AppleCare+. I'd rather keep my money with me, instead of anticipating a need to replace my entire phone.</p>

<p><sup id="fn1">1. Meaning that by the third incident, you've lost out on discounted repairs. <a href="http://ashleynh.me:80/applecare-plus/#ref1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩&#xfe0e;</a></sup></p>

    <p>Today is my last day at Dropbox.</p>

<p>I joined Dropbox two years ago. At the time, it was incredibly important to me to find the right culture fit. I wanted a team that had women engineers and fostered a collaborative, friendly environment. I’d recently left a startup where I was the only iOS engineer, so most of all I wanted a team with other iOS engineers that I could teach and learn from (read: nerd out with). To my pleasant surprise, I found all of that at Dropbox.</p>

<p>My time at Dropbox has been a tremendous period of growth for me. I’ve done more public speaking, worked on a large codebase with millions of users, and helped to shape how the company prioritizes accessibility moving forward. In short, I've had an amazing two years. </p>

<p>I’m leaving Dropbox to ensure that I continue to challenge myself. One day I want to lead the technical implementation of a venture I co-found. In order to get there, I need to fill the gaps that exist in my experience. The two most important areas I want to grow in are building a product from scratch, and providing technical leadership to a team of engineers. That’s why I’m thrilled to announce that I’ll be starting at <a href="https://www.glassbreakers.co">Glassbreakers</a> on March 1st. Glassbreakers doesn’t currently have a mobile app, and I’m looking forward to bringing a product from idea to market.</p>

        • by Pierre Igot
      
      
    </p></div>
    <p>
This has been a very traumatic few months for me as a Mac user. As indicated in several <a href="https://www.betalogue.com/2014/11/27/yosemite-responsiveness/">previous</a> <a href="https://www.betalogue.com/2014/12/08/yosemite-responsiveness-clean-install/">blog</a> <a href="https://www.betalogue.com/2014/12/19/yosemite-transparency-responsiveness/">posts</a>, I purchased a new Mac Pro along with a new 4K display back in July 2014. The machine shipped with Mavericks and worked pretty well until I upgraded to Yosemite.
</p>
<p>
I waited until OS X 10.10.1 came out before upgrading, but this was still not cautious enough. I soon realized that, on my Mac Pro, Yosemite suffered from significant responsiveness issues that were not tied to any specific piece of software or to a particularly high level of CPU activity.
</p>
<p>
When I say “significant”, I really mean it. These were not just slight delays that one can accept to live with in a 1.0 or 1.0.1 version of a new software product until the developers get around to further optimizing the software. These were massive, outrageous delays in seemingly simple tasks, such as switching apps, clicking on menu headings to pull them down, resizing windows, etc.
</p>
<p>
As an experienced troubleshooter myself, I went through all kinds of steps to try and isolate the problem and hopefully find a solution. Nothing worked. There was not a single application that I could identify as the culprit. It soon became quite clear to me, with my extensive experience as a troubleshooter, that this was a problem with the OS itself.
</p>
<p>
In desperation, I even went so far as to do a brand new “clean install” of my system and applications — something that I hadn’t done in years. When you use a fairly advanced setup such as mine, with a number of third-party applications and lots of customizations (none of which would qualify as “hacks”, although Apple probably does not do much in-house testing to ensure that utilities such as <a href="http://www.stclairsoft.com/DefaultFolderX/release.html" target="_blank">Default Folder X</a>, <a href="http://www.ergonis.com/products/typinator/">Typinator</a> and <a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/">Keyboard Maestro</a> always work well with their latest system software), doing a clean install is a very tedious, time-consuming process, because you not only have to migrate all your files back and reinstall all your applications, but also restore all the customizations one by one, without relying on existing application support files that might have somehow become “corrupted”.
</p>
<p>
But I did it, and even before I had completed the process of restoring all my customizations, I knew that the clean install had not solved the issue.
</p>
<p>
The problem with responsiveness issues is obviously that they are somewhat subjective. I am a fast typist and, generally speaking, a fast GUI user. I even use <a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/">Keyboard Maestro</a> to automate a number of repetitive interactions with the GUI using macros; those macros effectively mimic the behaviour of an extremely fast GUI user. So I am particularly sensitive to responsiveness issues. And let me tell you, on my machine at least, the situation was a nightmare.
</p>
<p>
I had all kinds of Keyboard Maestro macros that no longer worked properly because the system was not responsive enough, so I had to artificially add all kinds of built-in delays to the macros to try and make them work with the OS. (And even that only went so far, because the system&#8217;s own delays were not consistent and predictable.)
</p>
<p>
But even in my own “manual” interactions with the Yosemite GUI, I was hampered by all kinds of undesirable delays that would cause me to miss targets, accidentally trigger things I didn’t mean to trigger, etc. It was maddening!
</p>
<p>
Given that my Mac Pro was a recent purchase and that this was clearly an unacceptable level of responsiveness on a supposedly fast machine, I felt that I had no choice but to go through Apple Care. I won’t get into all the details, because telling them in full would be far too long, but suffice to say that I “burned through” four different “senior representatives”, who all agreed that what I was experiencing was unacceptable, but were at a loss to explain it, let alone reproduce it themselves or get their engineering counterparts to acknowledge the seriousness of the situation and do something about it.
</p>
<p>
Things were so bad that there was talk, at some point, of downgrading to OS X 10.9, or even of trying to get my Mac Pro’s video cards replaced, in case that might somehow miraculously fix the problem — as if it wasn’t obvious enough that this was a software problem and not a hardware problem.
</p>
<p>
I spent a lot of time executing troubleshooting tasks for the senior representatives, or for the engineering people that they were talking to about my issues, all the while knowing very well that none of them would do anything to fix the problem.
</p>
<p>
What was particularly maddening, of course, was that responsiveness issues are hard to capture, and also tend to be intermittent in nature, which means that you often cannot reproduce them on demand. However, I did end up purchasing a piece of software (<a href="http://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm">ScreenFlow</a>) that enabled me to create video captures of some of the most egregious problems, and I was also able to narrow down, to some extent, the circumstances under which the responsiveness problems would occur.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, I also wasted a lot of time on what can only be described, in retrospect, as wild goose chases, because I was seeing various behaviours that seemed to be connected but ultimately proved to be unrelated (or loosely related at best) to my responsiveness issues. For instance, I couldn’t help but notice that Yosemite was eating up the 32 GB of physical RAM on my Mac Pro like candy, and that responsiveness issues seemed to be getting worse the closer I got to 32 GB of memory used. The last senior representative that I talked to seemed to be unable to find out whether this kind of RAM usage was normal in Yosemite or not, and couldn’t explain, for instance, how a single web page left open in Safari could end up <a href="https://twitter.com/betalogue/status/574291810111127552">using 1.5+ GB of memory</a> <em>all by itself</em>, on top of the memory used by the Safari process itself.
</p>
<p>
While Apple Care’s representatives proved to be unable to help me in any significant way, I was fortunate enough to get a variety of suggestions and tips from readers of this blog and my <a href="https://twitter.com/betalogue">Twitter feed</a>. This is how, for example, I found out that having turned the “<span class="interfaceitem">Reduce transparency</span>” option on in the Accessibility settings in System Preferences was actually causing a <a href="https://www.betalogue.com/2014/12/19/yosemite-transparency-responsiveness/">significant menu-flashing bug</a> on top of my general responsiveness issues, and I ended up using the “<span class="interfaceitem">Increase contrast</span>” option in the same Accessibility settings for a while, because it helped reduce the severity of this bug and also, somehow, seemed to slightly alleviate the general responsiveness issues in Yosemite on my machine.
</p>
<p>
I, of course, had mentioned to the Apple Care representatives that I was also a member of AppleSeed and, as such, had access to early builds of the next system upgrade, OS X 10.10.3. (OS X 10.10.2 had come out early on with no improvements.) I asked whether it was a good idea, in my circumstances, to give those early builds of 10.10.3 a try. The representative that I was in touch with at the time was obviously at a loss himself and figured that I didn’t have much to lose. So I did proceed with the installation.
</p>
<p>
The very first 10.10.3 build available through AppleSeed included the new Photos application, but did nothing to alleviate my problems, so I was not particularly hopeful that things would get better in subsequent builds (worried as I was that the focus would be mostly on this new Photos application and not on fixing bugs).
</p>
<p>
But then two things happened. I got a tip from a reader about <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/osx/comments/2q8pv8/ui_performance_decline_os_x_tiger_yosemite/cn432yu">this post on Reddit</a>, which suggested a link between responsiveness issues in Yosemite and a specific kernel extension (<span class="filename">AppleGraphicsPowerManagement.kext</span>). I was intrigued, because I had always suspected (with my limited knowledge of the engineering underpinnings of OS X) that, in the effort to minimize battery consumption for laptop computers, Apple had gone too far in implementing mechanisms that put all kinds of things to sleep automatically when idle. Certainly, several of my responsiveness issues looked like problems where, when I was clicking on something, the computer system appeared to be somehow “waking up”, and only responded to my clicks after a few seconds. And of course, my responsiveness issues had everything to do with the GUI, i.e. with “graphics”, and I had been suspecting problems with graphics drivers all along.
</p>
<p>
And then within a few hours of that discovery, AppleSeed released a new build of the OS X 10.10.3 update, which I installed, and which included a number of updated versions of kernel extensions, including this particular one (and several other graphics drivers)!
</p>
<p>
I soon realized that this update was a major step forward, that it clearly addressed several of the issues that I had been experiencing. For instance, the menu-flashing bug was completely gone. There would still be the occasional slight delay between a click on a menu heading or button and the appearance of the actual menu, but there was no longer a problem with the menu flashing and disappearing before I had a chance to make a selection.
</p>
<p>
Most important, however, was the fact that the general problem with the massive delays that I had been experiencing on my Mac Pro was gone.
</p>
<p>
I am not sure I can convey how relieved I felt at this point. I immediately communicated with the Apple Care senior representative that I was in touch with. He, of course, had no inkling that this particular build might feature any bug fix that would address the problem that we had been discussing for over two months. He was just as pleasantly surprised to hear about this.
</p>
<p>
While I was expressing my huge relief to him, I also made it quite clear that I didn’t feel that this outcome made everything alright and that everything that had come before then was forgotten (let alone forgiven). For one thing, I had no guarantee (nor did he) that whatever this particular build fixed would not be broken again in subsequent builds. Since no one on the engineering side had communicated with him about the fact that this build might contain a fix, we had no idea whether the fix was even intentional — and not simply an accidental by-product of some other improvement or optimization.
</p>
<p>
In fact, I was so worried about this that I refrained from installing any subsequent builds of the 10.10.3 update until the official update came out last week. I wanted to make sure that I had a system that worked, and given that I was otherwise very busy, the easiest solution was to do nothing. Then when the update finally came out, I made sure I had an up-to-date backup of my existing system that was updated right before I installed the update, and I made sure I immediately tested the final version of the update to confirm that the responsiveness problems had not come back. (They had not.)
</p>
<p>
I also made it quite clear to the senior representative that I felt that there had been massive communication issues between the engineering side and the customer service side at Apple, and that this had caused me and him to waste lots of time on wild goose chases and other useless (in retrospect) troubleshooting steps. While he himself was at least getting paid for dealing with me, I, on the other hand, had no way to get any compensation for the countless hours I had spent on troubleshooting this problem. If at least Apple’s engineers had said, early on, “Yes, we know that there is a major responsiveness issue for some users, and we’re working on a fix, which should be available around such and such a date”, then we would not have wasted so much time!
</p>
<p>
There is a part of me that still hasn’t forgiven Apple for this, and maybe never will. The whole experience has been very traumatizing, and I am really angry at Apple for having caused me to waste so much of my time on trying to fix a problem that I could do nothing about. As I said to the senior representative, “the impression of callousness on the part of Apple&#8217;s engineers will take a very long time to dissipate”. I realize that this particular problem probably only affected a small minority of users, but when someone goes through four different senior representatives, provides reliable scenarios for reproducing specific issues, provides graphic evidence in the form of screen captures (the engineers even asked me to record a video of my monitor with my iPhone at some point!), and clearly demonstrates that he is no fool and knows what he is talking about, the issue has to be treated more seriously and professionally, with a more acceptable level of… responsiveness in the communication itself.
</p>
<p>
I cannot help but feel, at times, that Apple’s engineers think that they are above all this and incapable of making such egregious mistakes that cause significant hardship for some of their users. While I agree that customer complaints might not always be entirely legitimate and that some users are fussy and moan about things that, in the big picture, are really rather small potatoes, this was not one of those cases. The issues I had were very real, and the very fact that they were suddenly fixed by a single system update proves that they were.
</p>

Because of the lack of communication, I still don’t know if Apple’s engineers even <strong>realize</strong> that they have fixed those significant responsiveness issues for me (and hopefully others). Part of me is still afraid that I might encounter a regression in a future system update. But at least now I had an official version of Yosemite that I can fall back on if things go awry again.
</p>
<p>
In closing, I should also stress that this is not the end of my complaints about responsiveness in Yosemite. There are still multiple aspects of the GUI in Yosemite that don’t feel right to me. The responsiveness issues are no longer egregious to the point that I find them unbearable, but there are still problems, including several bugs that I identified in the process of trying to further circumscribe the issues that were specific to my Mac Pro and mistakenly took as manifestations of these issues, when in fact they were just made <em>more visible and noticeable</em> by the massive delays that my responsiveness issues were causing.
</p>
<p>
I still often notice, for example, a slight delay between the time I click on a menu heading in the toolbar and the time the blue highlighting behind the heading comes on and the menu below gets drawn. It’s a small fraction of a second, but it’s noticeable. It doesn’t affect my ability to use the menu, but it makes the whole process <em>feel</em> slower.
</p>
<p>
The particular problem that I identified in <a href="https://www.betalogue.com/2014/11/27/yosemite-responsiveness/">this blog post</a> about the blue highlighting for the “<span class="menuheading">Help</span>” menu is still there. It’s cosmetic, but it looks sloppy.
</p>
<p>
The bug in OS X’s Preview that causes it to <a href="https://www.betalogue.com/2015/03/09/yosemite-preview-window-resizing-continued/">fail to keep up with fast window resizing</a> (especially when using a Keyboard Maestro macro) is still there.
</p>
<p>
And there are, more generally, multiple situations where you can almost witness the process of Yosemite “building” the user interface in real time. For example, yesterday I posted on Twitter a link to <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/hccj0q4vav3weas/Yosemite-SystemPrefs-Slow.mp4?dl=0">this video recording</a> that I created and that shows what happens when I play back, in slow motion, a video recording of System Preferences drawing the “<span class="interfaceitem">General</span>” preference pane in real time in Yosemite. This video clip, which is effectively the recording of the playback of a recording, shows that there is a delay of 0.07 second between the time the contents of the “<span class="interfaceitem">General</span>” preference pane appear and the time some of the blue highlighting that should be part of the UI appears (the blue highlights on the radio buttons, the blue highlights on the arrows for the pop-up menus, etc.).
</p>
<p>
Why is there such a delay? It is not caused by some background activity that would happen to be slowing my system down at the time. The 0.07-second delay happens each and every time I access the “<span class="interfaceitem">General</span>” preference pane. It’s a small delay, but it’s noticeable. And it certainly contributes to the feeling that Yosemite is slow, even if it’s not really that slow.
</p>
<p>
I don’t know what Apple did to the GUI in Yosemite. They clearly rebuilt a lot of things (the font change to Helvetica playing an important part in this process), and in the process they created a lack of smoothness, fluidity, and zippiness that is really quite disturbing. It makes you feel like you using a system that is somehow more “fragile”, less reliable, less solid and could fall apart at any point — something that Apple’s engineers have decided is “good enough” for most people, but that more demanding, more attentive users will find rather disappointing and unworthy of Apple’s legendary attention to detail (which is becoming more and more of a legend and less and less of a reality with every passing year, I am afraid).
</p>
<p>
I cannot finish this post without thanking all the Betalogue readers and Twitter followers who have written to me to share their own stories and offer suggestions, tips, or simply commiseration. Unlike Apple’s customer service, they were actually able, collectively, to make a difference for me, and I can only hope that, with this blog post, I in turn might able to make a difference for other users.</p>

    <p>
Here’s another example of Apple’s sloppy work in OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) that is very easy to reproduce (at least on my Mac Pro):
</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Activity Monitor application (in the <span class="filename">Application/Utilities</span> folder).</li>
<li>Option-click on your desktop to hide the foreground application, i.e. Activity Monitor, and switch back to the Finder.</li>
<li>Click on the Activity Monitor icon in the Dock or press <kbd>command-Tab</kbd> to switch back to Activity Monitor.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Notice anything? The toolbar now looks like this:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.betalogue.com/images/uploads/macosx/yosemite-activity-monitor1.png" target="_blank" title="Click to see full-size image."><img alt="yosemite-activity-monitor1" height="54" src="https://www.betalogue.com/images/uploads/macosx/yosemite-activity-monitor1.png" width="437" /></a>
</p>
<p>
Normally, when Activity Monitor is in the foreground, the toolbar should look like this:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.betalogue.com/images/uploads/macosx/yosemite-activity-monitor2.png" target="_blank" title="Click to see full-size image."><img alt="yosemite-activity-monitor2" height="54" src="https://www.betalogue.com/images/uploads/macosx/yosemite-activity-monitor2.png" width="437" /></a>
</p>
<p>
In other words, somehow Yosemite “forgets” to switch the background chrome of the window toolbar back to its foreground version. Yet the window is indeed in the foreground, as indicated by the three coloured buttons on the left, which are coloured (and not greyed-out), i.e. in the state they are supposed to be in when the window is in the foreground.
</p>
<p>
And even the other toolbar buttons that look like they are in the background and disabled are actually active and you can click on them. (This actually forces them to switch back to their normal foreground state visually, one by one.)
</p>
<p>
So the issue is purely cosmetic. But it’s still very sloppy on Apple’s part.
</p>
<p>
I haven’t been able to reproduce this problem with any other application. I also cannot reproduce the problem when step #2 in the process above involves choosing “<span class="menuitem">Hide Activity Monitor</span>” in the “<span class="menuheading">Activity Monitor</span>” application menu. But I can also reproduce it when I switch to another application and use “<span class="menuitem">Hide Others</span>” to hide all other applications, including Activity Monitor.
</p>
<p>
Fixing the problem involves switching to another application and then back to Activity Monitor. This forces a “refresh” of the window display and then Activity Monitor uses the appropriate chrome for the foreground window.
</p>
<p>
This is not the first bug I have encountered in OS X with the system&#8217;s commands for hiding applications. Long-time Betalogue readers might remember that I reported, back in 2012, on a <a href="https://www.betalogue.com/2012/09/20/lion-selectionhighlighting/">selection-highlighting bug</a> that was first introduced in Lion and has been with us ever since. Because of this bug, after I use “<span class="menuitem">Hide Others</span>” to hide all applications other than the foreground application, if the applications thus hidden include Mail, when I bring Mail back to the foreground, it continues to use the background (grey) colour to highlight messages in the message list, and it also fails to make the I-beam cursor visible in messages that are in the process of being edited.
</p>
<p>
The same bug also affects, for some reason, stand-alone Safari-based web browsers created with the <a href="http://fluidapp.com/">Fluid</a> application. I have several of those and they all suffer from the same problem as Mail. If they are hidden by “<span class="menuitem">Hide Others</span>” and then brought back to the foreground, the selection highlighting is all wrong.
</p>
<p>
Here again, fixing the problem involves switching to another application and then back to Mail or the affected stand-alone browser app. In fact, it’s such an annoyance that I have created <a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/">Keyboard Maestro</a> macros to execute this fix each time I switch to those applications, because I use “<span class="menuitem">Hide Others</span>” all the time and so my stand-alone browser apps often end up in this undesirable state.
</p>
<p>
This selection-highlighting bug has now been with us for three years. And now, thanks to Apple’s sloppy work in Yosemite, we can add a new one to the list, which only affects Activity Monitor, but is definitely easy to reproduce (at least on my system).
</p>
<p>
Sigh.</p>

    <p>
Since my original post about a <a href="https://www.betalogue.com/2015/03/06/yosemite-preview-fast-resizing/">bug with window resizing in Preview in Yosemite</a>, I have received feedback indicating that not everyone is able to reproduce this bug on their system.
</p>
<p>
This leads me to suspect that the problem might be limited to specific hardware configurations, like the other responsiveness issues that I have be experiencing since upgrading to Yosemite, which seem to all involve issues of drawing/refreshing the contents of windows, menus, etc. on the screen.
</p>
<p>
In my original post, I indicated that, in order to reproduce the problem, you really had to use <strong>very quick mouse movements</strong> in Preview, which will cause it to fail to keep up with your window resizing and only partly resize its contents to fit the frame.
</p>
<p>
I also indicated that the issue was particularly noticeable when using <a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/">Keyboard Maestro</a> macros, because these macros effectively mimic very fast mouse movements — in fact faster than what the human hand can achieve.
</p>
<p>
This means that, while reproducing the problem with a human hand can be challenging, with a Keyboard Maestro macro I am able to reproduce the bug reliably 100% of the time.
</p>
<p>
So in the interest of further identifying the circumstances under which this Yosemite bug occurs, here is a scenario involving Keyboard Maestro that makes it possible to reproduce the bug without fail:
</p>
<ol>
<li>If you don’t have it yet, download and install <a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/">Keyboard Maestro</a> on your system.</li>
<li>Create the following macro (or download it <a href="https://www.betalogue.com/images/uploads/keyboardmaestro/Resize.kmmacros.zip">here</a> and import it) or a similar one:</li>
<p><img alt="km-resize" height="226" src="https://www.betalogue.com/images/uploads/keyboardmaestro/km-resize.png" width="423" /></p>
<li>Open any PDF document in Preview and switch the view mode to “<span class="menuitem">Single Page</span>” (in the “<span class="menuheading">View</span>” menu).</li>
<li>Make the Preview window containing the PDF fairly small.</li>
<li>Execute the macro.</li>
</ol>
<p>
If you have the same bug I have on my system (a 2014 Mac Pro), then the window will resize properly, but Preview will entirely fail to scale the contents to fit the resized window, as it normally should.
</p>
<p>
The only way to force Preview to scale the contents of the window is to adjust the window size a second time. This will force it to “refresh” the contents and redraw the page at the size it should normally be in a window of that size.
</p>
<p>
If you can reproduce this bug on your system, I would be very interested to know about it. Please use the link in the sidebar to contact me and send me your hardware configuration.
</p>
<p>
Thanks!</p>

    <p>
Here’s a typical example of the many things that are wrong in Yosemite in terms of performance and responsiveness. When you first upgrade to Yosemite, you might notice all kinds of different responsiveness issues and it can be all quite confusing, giving you a general impression of unresponsiveness even though you cannot quite clearly pinpoint what is wrong.
</p>
<p>
Over time, however, it gradually becomes easier to identify specific behaviours in specific applications that help explain this general impression. Here is one such specific behaviour.
</p>
<p>
It has to do with the Preview application and with what happens when you view a PDF in “Single Page” view mode and you resize the window to make it bigger.
</p>
<p>
In order to reproduce the problem you need to do the following:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Open a PDF file (any PDF file will do) in Preview.</li>
<li>In Preview, go to the “<span class="menuheading">View</span>” menu and select the “<span class="menuitem">Single Page</span>” option (as opposed to the default “<span class="menuitem">Continuous Scroll</span>”).</li>
<li>Then grab the bottom-right corner of the window and resize it to make it quite small.</li>
<li>Then grab the bottom-right corner of the window again and drag it to the right and down <strong>as fast as you can</strong> with your mouse. </li>
</ol>
<p>
The speed is important here. If you drag it at a “normal” speed, you won’t encounter any problems.
</p>
<p>
If you drag it fast enough, on the other hand, sooner or later this will happen:
</p>
<p><code><video controls="controls" height="404" src="https://www.betalogue.com/images/uploads/preview/Preview-Resize.mp4" width="445"></video></code></p>
<p>
(<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/5oam6kktiuaparc/Preview-Resize.mp4?dl=0">Click here</a> to get the MP4 video on DropBox.)
</p>
<p>
Note the situation in the video around the 02:00 mark: Even though the window’s bottom-right corner is near the edge of the video frame, the bottom-right corner of the PDF page is nowhere near that edge. It’s because I’ve resized the window too fast for Preview, and it has failed to keep up with my mouse movement.
</p>
<p>
But I’ve kept my mouse button down. And around the 03:00 mark, I nudge the mouse pointer a little bit more, which forces Preview to finally refresh its display of the PDF page so that it properly fills the space available inside the window’s edge (allowing for a tiny bit of padding for esthetic reasons, of course).
</p>
<p>
How pathetic is this? My hardware is not to blame: I have a very powerful 2014 Mac Pro with tons of RAM, and there’s nothing running in the background that would excuse such a shortcoming. (In actual fact, the <a href="http://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm">ScreenFlow</a> application is running and recording all this in real time, of course, but this behaviour is perfectly reproducible even when ScreenFlow is not running.)
</p>
<p>
Now, you might be tempted to say: “Yeah, but who resizes at that speed with the mouse anyway? If you resize at a more ‘normal’ speed, there is no problem here.” And that might be what Apple’s engineers think. (In other words, things are “good enough” for most users here.)
</p>
<p>
Well, for one thing, this is a pretty sad attitude to have. There is no question that my Mac is powerful enough and that Preview should <strong>not</strong> be struggling with this. Any self-respecting engineer who strives for excellence in his or her work should be dissatisfied with this and insist that the problem be fixed.
</p>
<p>
And then there&#8217;s the fact that it effectively penalizes users for being too fast! In what world is that considered OK? We live in an age of superfast hardware that should have no trouble keeping up with human interactions, especially when everything is local and no networking is involved. Yes, I am a fast user. So what? Does it really make me a <strong>bad</strong> user?
</p>
<p>
Finally, there’s one more thing: This shortcoming has a significant impact on people who, like me, might use <a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/">Keyboard Maestro</a> to automate various tasks, including the moving and resizing of windows in OS X. I have two large monitors and I have several macros that enable me to automatically move and resize my windows in any OS X application, including Preview, so that I can easily organize my document windows side by side on either screen.
</p>
<p>
I often have four different documents open in four different windows side by side and my large screens enable me to me to view these documents at a fairly low zoom level while maintaining legibility. But the two screens do not have the same size/resolution, and so when I switch a document window from one screen to the other I need to resize it. If that resizing involves a PDF document open in a window in Preview, then guess what happens?
</p>
<p>
Well, for window manipulation, <a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/">Keyboard Maestro</a>’s macros effectively behave like a superfast user, mimicking mouse movements at the fastest possible speed. So of course they are going to be affected by this bug in Yosemite’s Preview application. Sure enough, every time I use a macro that includes a step like this one:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.betalogue.com/images/uploads/keyboardmaestro/km-move-resize-window.png" target="_blank" title="Click to see full-size image."><img alt="km-move-resize-window" height="66" src="https://www.betalogue.com/images/uploads/keyboardmaestro/km-move-resize-window.png" width="394" /></a>
</p>
<p>
and the window involved happens to be on my second screen, where the window size has to be smaller, the macro correctly moves it to the main screen and correctly resizes the window to fill the bigger screen, but Preview fails to keep up with it and so the PDF page in the window is not resized properly.
</p>
<p>
In fact, Keyboard Maestro is faster than I’ll ever be with my mouse, and it’s so fast that Preview fails to resize the PDF page itself altogether! The window is bigger, but the PDF page keeps the same size it had on the secondary screen.
</p>
<p>
The only solution that I have found to work around this problem is to add an extra step to the macro, just for Preview:
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.betalogue.com/images/uploads/keyboardmaestro/km-move-resize-window-nudge.png" target="_blank" title="Click to see full-size image."><img alt="km-move-resize-window-nudge" height="213" src="https://www.betalogue.com/images/uploads/keyboardmaestro/km-move-resize-window-nudge.png" width="382" /></a></p>
<p>
This extra step effectively mimicks the little nudge illustrated around the 03:00 mark in the video above, which forces Preview to refresh its display of the PDF page so that it finally fills the space available inside the window.
</p>
<p>
But it’s not an ideal solution, because any extra step like this increases the risk that something might go wrong during the execution of the macro. If Yosemite experiences any kind of “hiccup” during the execution (which it tends to do), then the nudge might not work as expected and I will still have to resize the window manually in order to force Preview to refresh its display of the PDF page.
</p>
<p>
This is a new problem in Yosemite. Preview in Mavericks never had such a problem, and I had been using my Keyboard Maestro macros with it for a long time without a hitch.
</p>
<p>
When people talk about Apple’s sloppy work in Yosemite, I believe that this is the kind of thing that they are thinking of. It took me a while to narrow it down because of <a href="https://www.betalogue.com/2014/12/19/yosemite-transparency-responsiveness/">all the other responsiveness problems</a> I was having with Yosemite, but this, as far as I can tell, is an easily reproducible problem for anyone running Yosemite, even people who don’t have the egregious responsiveness problems that I have been experiencing.
</p>
<p>
When will Apple get around to fixing it (if ever)? Unfortunately, because the application works “well enough” for the majority of users, I am not too optimistic, which is why I’ll have to keep this extra “nudge” step in my macros and in my own dragging movements for quite a while, I fear.

    </p></div>
    <p>
If you’ve ever felt like confusing the heck out of Word 2011 for OS X just for fun (and who wouldn’t, really?), try this:
</p>
<ol>
<li>In the Finder, create a folder called “<span class="filename">Confused Word</span>” on your desktop.</li>
<li>In Word 2011, create a new document and save it as “<span class="filename">Test1.docx</span>” in the “<span class="filename">Confused Word</span>” folder. Leave the document open in a document window in Word.</li>
<li>In the Finder, select the “<span class="filename">Test1.docx</span>” file in the “<span class="filename">Confused </span>Word” folder, make its name editable, and change it to “<span class="filename">Test2.docx</span>”.</li>
<li>Switch back to Word 2011 and confirm that the document window you left open now has the document title “<span class="filename">Test2.docx</span>” instead of “<span class="filename">Test1.docx</span>”.</li>
<li>Switch back to the Finder, select the newly renamed “<span class="filename">Test2.docx</span>” file and duplicate it to create a second file in the same folder called “<span class="filename">Test2 copy.docx</span>”.</li>
<li>Make the file name “<span class="filename">Test2 copy.docx</span>” editable and change it to “<span class="filename">Test1.docx</span>”.</li>
<li>Double-click on “<span class="filename">Test1.docx</span>” to open it in Word 2011.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The first strange thing that happens is that the “<span class="filename">Test1.docx</span>” document opens as “<span class="filename">Read-Only</span>”. Why? I have absolutely no idea.
</p>
<p>
But now hit <kbd>command-S</kbd> in Word 2011 to save the “<span class="filename">Test1.docx</span>” document that is labelled “<span class="filename">Read-Only</span>”.
</p>
<p>
Since it’s (allegedly) read-only, you’d think that Word 2011 would complain about your attempt to save it and ask you to save it under a new name or something, right?
</p>
<p>
Think again. Not only does Word 2011 not complain, but it actually changes the document title in the title bar to “<span class="filename">Test2.docx (Read-Only)</span>”!
</p>
<p>
As they say on the Interwebs, WTF?
</p>
<p>
It gets even funkier if, before hitting that <kbd>command-S</kbd> shortcut, you actually make some changes to the contents of the “<span class="filename">Test1.docx</span>” document. In that case, when you hit <kbd>command-S</kbd>, Word changes the document title in the title bar to “<span class="filename">Test2.docx</span>”, without the “<span class="filename">Ready-Only</span>” part. And guess what happens to the “<span class="filename">Test2.docx</span>” document that you’d left open in the other document window in Word 2011?
</p>
<p>
It gets renamed to something like “<span class="filename">Word Work File D_xxxxxx.tmp</span>”, where “<span class="filename">xxxxxx</span>” is a sequence of numbers. Admittedly, this is a very temporary situation, because as soon as you switch to another app and then back to Word 2011, the document title of that other document window changes back to “<span class="filename">Test2.docx</span>” as well.
</p>
<p>
So now you have two document windows with the same document title/file name and two different states for the content (since you typed something else in that other document window before hitting <kbd>command-S</kbd>, remember?).
</p>
<p>
And now guess what happens when you close those two document windows and return to the Finder?
</p>
<p>
Well, there are no longer two files inside that “<span class="filename">Confused Word</span>” folder on your desktop. There’s only one file left, called “<span class="filename">Test1.docx</span>”, and its contents do not include the changes you made to the document before hitting <kbd>command-S</kbd>.
</p>
<p>
Nice to know you’ve got our backs, Microsoft.</p>
