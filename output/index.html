    <p><a href="http://bookfeed.io/">Bookfeed.io</a> is a simple tool that allows you to specify a list of authors, and generates an RSS feed with each author&#8217;s most recently released book.[^book] I made this because I don&#8217;t want a recommendation algorithm to tell me what to read, I just want to know when my favorite authors release new books.</p>

<p>[^book]: Just to avoid any confusion, it doesn&#8217;t contain the actual content of the book, it  links to the Google Books page for the book.</p>

<p>Go to <a href="http://bookfeed.io/">Bookfeed.io</a>, and then:</p>

<ol>
<li>Click on &laquo;Make my Feed&raquo;</li>
<li>Enter a list of author names (I use Google Books&#8217; APIs, so if you&#8217;re unsure how to spell an author&#8217;s name, verify the spelling on <a href="https://books.google.com/">books.google.com</a>)</li>
</ol>

<p><img alt="bookfeed.io edit feed ui" src="http://ignorethecode.net/upload/781/bookfeed.png" /></p>

<p>That&#8217;s it. Simply add the feed to your RSS reader, and you&#8217;ll get a new entry in your feed when an author in your list releases a new book. To add a new author, or remove an author, just go to the link defined in the feed. In feedly, for example, click on the feed&#8217;s title.</p>

<p><img alt="bookfeed.io feed in feedly" src="http://ignorethecode.net/upload/781/feedly.jpg" /></p>

<p>I&#8217;ll do my best to keep this running, but I don&#8217;t have any control over Google Books, so don&#8217;t yell at me when this goes down, or misses a book. Thank you.</p>

      <h3 class="fullpost_title"><a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/IgnoreTheCode/~3/SA3PNOFrJZU/">Switching to Windows</a></h3>
    </div>
    <div class="article_meta"><p>
      On 02 February 2021 at 06:59&thinsp;pm
      • ignorethecode.net
      
      
    </p></div>
    <p>Around 2015, I started to realize that I was no longer part of Apple&#8217;s target audience. I&#8217;ve since found that Windows, and the devices available on the Windows side, from gaming laptops to convertibles to custom-built PCs, are just a better match for my requirements.</p>

<p>At this point, I have only one piece of Apple hardware still in active use: a 17-inch MacBook Pro[^best] that runs Coda and EagleFiler.</p>

<p>[^best]: Also known as the best MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>Since a lot of people seem to be making the switch now, maybe it&#8217;s helpful to talk about some things I&#8217;m doing to make Windows more amenable to my Mac habits. Here&#8217;s what I do when I set up a new Windows PC.</p>

<h1>Things to Install</h1>

<h2>QuickLook</h2>

<p>QuickLook is one thing I genuinely miss on Windows. Fortunately, there&#8217;s a great open-source alternative available <a href="https://github.com/QL-Win/QuickLook">on GitHub</a>. It even has a plugin system, which makes it possible to preview even more obscure file formats - <a href="https://github.com/jeremyhart/QuickLook.Plugin.HelixViewer">STLs</a>, for example.</p>

<h2>PowerToys</h2>

<p>On Macs, I always launch apps using Spotlight&#8217;s Cmd-Space shortcut. On Windows, you can just hit the Windows key to open the Start menu, and type the app&#8217;s name to launch it, but if you prefer the lightweight OS X-style Spotlight UI, <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys">PowerToys makes it available on Windows</a>. It also does a bunch of other <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/">really cool stuff</a>, like providing a global color picker, and adding an image resizer and a bulk file renamer to the Explorer&#8217;s context menu.</p>

<h2>FileMarker.NET Pro</h2>

<p>I often made use of the ability to tag files in OS X, and Windows lacks a similar feature, but <a href="https://filemarker.net/file-marker-pro.php">FileMarker.NET Pro</a>[^filemarker] solves that problem.</p>

<p>[^filemarker]: I can&#8217;t help myself, I still always read that as &laquo;FileMaker Pro.&raquo;</p>

<h2>PeaZIP</h2>

<p>Windows does support file compression natively, but I prefer <a href="https://peazip.github.io/">PeaZip</a>. As far as I can tell, <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/">7-zip</a> is more widely recommended amongst Windows users, but what do they know? PeaZip has a very clean UI, and nice green icons, so it&#8217;s very obviously the better choice.</p>

<h2>WinDirStat</h2>

<p>One of the first things I install on any Mac I use, because I&#8217;ll always need it sooner or later, is <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/more">OmniDiskSweeper</a>. There&#8217;s no OmniDiskSweeper on Windows, but there is <a href="https://windirstat.net/">WinDirStat</a>, which does the same thing, with the added benefit of having Pac-Man.</p>

<p>An alternative to WinDirStat is <a href="https://wiztreefree.com/">WizTree</a>. Its main advantage is that it is insanely fast. It analyzes my whole disk in a few seconds.</p>

<h2>AutoHotKey</h2>

<p>I was a little worried about not having AppleScript, but nowadays, it really doesn&#8217;t work all that well on Macs, either, and when I found <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">AutoHotKey</a>, all was well.</p>

<h2>Other Stuff</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m now using <a href="https://www.edrawsoft.com/ad/edraw-max-soft-t.html">Edraw Max</a> instead of <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle/">OmniGraffle</a>, but I&#8217;m not entirely satisfied with it. I&#8217;m using <a href="https://en.taiwebs.com/windows/download-pdf-compressor-pro-600.html">PDF Compressor Pro</a> as an alternative to shrinking PDFs with Preview on the Mac. Also, I use <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/how-to-install-wsl2-on-windows-10">WSL2 for Unix-y goodness</a>, and <a href="https://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey</a> instead of <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>.</p>

<p>I also usually install MSI Afterburner to customize the graphic card fan curve, and the official GPU drivers from Nvidia or AMD, instead of relying on whatever Windows auto-installs.</p>

<p>Finally, Windows has built-in screen sharing, but only if you have a Pro license. You can upgrade your license if your computer didn&#8217;t come with a Pro license.</p>

<h1>Settings I Change</h1>

<p>Here are some of the settings I change on all Windows PCs I use.</p>

<h2>Make the Start Menu Full-Screen</h2>

<p>When I hit the start menu, it&#8217;s because I want to launch an application. I don&#8217;t need to see the rest of the desktop. So why is the Start menu by default only occupying a small portion of the screen, and wasting the remaining space? I switch my Start menu to full-screen. It looks good, and it gives Windows a nice little home screen.[^home]</p>

<p>[^home]: Windows 8 was the best version of Windows. And that&#8217;s just a fact.</p>

<p><img alt="Windows Full-Screen Start Menu" src="http://ignorethecode.net/upload/780/start_menu.jpg" /></p>

<h2>Turn Off Wallpaper Sync</h2>

<p>By default, if you log in with the same account on multiple PCs, Microsoft will sync some settings between these devices. That&#8217;s nice. One of these settings is the wallpaper. That&#8217;s not nice. I turn it off in the Accounts settings.</p>

<h2>Set Up Clipboard Sharing and Multi-Clipboard</h2>

<p>In the Clipboard settings, I turn on &laquo;Save multiple items in the clipboard to use later.&raquo; It&#8217;s super annoying to forget to turn it on, because when you need it, it&#8217;s too late. Why isn&#8217;t this just turned on by default? Also, I turn on &laquo;Sync across devices,&raquo; so I can copy on one device, and paste on another. I also set up the Smartphone app, so I can copy on my Android phone, and paste on Windows - great for things like two-factor authentication codes.</p>

<h2>Make the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/03/curse_words">Cursor</a> Black</h2>

<p>Black with a white outline is the correct color for the mouse pointer. Most of the stuff on most people&#8217;s screens is white. It makes no sense to have a white mouse pointer.</p>

<p><img src="http://ignorethecode.net/upload/780/cursor.jpg" /></p>

<p>Fortunately, it&#8217;s easy to change the default Windows cursor to the correct color in the Mouse pointer settings. Unfortunately, even when changed to black, the misshapen Windows mouse pointer&#8217;s stem <a href="http://ignorethecode.net/upload/780/bent_out_of_shape.jpg">still doesn&#8217;t align with its point</a>.</p>

<h2>Add the Trash to the Start Menu, and Remove It from the Desktop</h2>

<p>Since Windows&#8217; window management works much better than what OS X&#8217;s does, and guides users towards tiling their windows, the desktop on Windows is almost always covered by windows. So I just add the Trash can (or, as these peculiar Windows users like to wrongly call it, &laquo;Recycle bin&raquo;) to the Start menu, and then remove it from the Desktop altogether. This can be done in the Theme settings by clicking on &laquo;Desktop Icon Settings.&raquo;</p>

<h1>Stuff to Remember</h1>

<p>Here are some additional things to keep in mind when switching from a Mac to Windows.</p>

<h2>Screenshots</h2>

<p>Hit Win-Shift-S instead of Cmd-Shift-4. &laquo;S&raquo; does kind of make a little more sense for &laquo;screenshot&raquo; than &laquo;4&raquo;, I think. You might want to install the Snip &amp; Sketch tool if it isn&#8217;t installed by default, and turn on its notifications, so that after creating a screenshot, you get a popup of the screenshot you just took. Click on the popup to edit the screenshot.</p>

<h2>Screen Recordings</h2>

<p>You can make screen recordings using the Xbox Dashboard by hitting Win-G.</p>

<h2>Launching Apps</h2>

<p>Instead of Shift-Space, just hit Win, and start typing the name of the app you want to launch.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="article_meta"><p>
      On 24 December 2020 at 07:43&thinsp;am
      • ignorethecode.net
      
      
    </p></div>
    <p>Facebook recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178068/facebook-apple-newspaper-ads-ios-privacy-changes">took out full-page ads in the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal attacking the way Apple protects its users&#8217; privacy</a>. In the ad, they make the point that Apple harms Facebook&#8217;s ability to track people who see Facebook&#8217;s ads, and run personalized ads, which, according to Facebook, harms the effectiveness and thus the value of these ads.</p>

<p>This is kind of strange, if you think about it.</p>

<p>Why would Facebook take out a huge non-personalized ad to make the point that, for ads to really work, they need to be personalized? Why advertise in a newspaper if they think that personalized ads are so much more effective?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s because the idea that personalization increases the value of ads is wrong. Personalization <em>harms</em> the value of ads, because it measures the value of ads based on a metric that doesn&#8217;t really apply to most ads.</p>

<p>Personalized ads that use user tracking measure ads based on a direct causal relationship between users seeing an ad, and users acting on that ad by buying the product advertised in the ad. By that metric, the vast majority of ads just don&#8217;t work. People don&#8217;t see an ad for a product, and then buy that product immediately, or perhaps a few days later.</p>

<p>(In fact, every time scientists try to measure the effectiveness of advertising, <a href="https://freakonomics.com/podcast/advertising-part-1/">it turns out to not be very effective at all</a>.)</p>

<p>Instead, the way ads work is that when people decide to buy a product, they will have more trust in products whose ads they see consistently, and whose products they associate with publications they trust. In other words, if you consistently see a car brand advertised in the New York Times, you will assume that this brand is trustworthy. When you decide to buy a new car, you will have a preference for that brand.</p>

<p>This doesn&#8217;t just work for large publications and huge brands. If you see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ5aqx02QDI">LTT consistently have sponsorships from Seasonic</a>, you will be more likely to trust a Seasonic power supply for your next PC. If you see Kandji regularly sponsor Daring Fireball, you&#8217;ll remember their name if you ever need the kind of product they offer.</p>

<p>But you will never see an ad for Mercedes on a website, and then just arbitrarily decide to buy a Mercedes based on having seen that ad. You will never see a Seasonic sponsorship, and just randomly decide to throw out your old power supply, and buy one from Seasonic. You&#8217;ll never see a Kandji sponsorship, and just decide that you suddenly, urgently need their product. Thus, by the metric we value user-tracked ads, most of them have no value at all.</p>

<p>If Facebook wanted to increase the value of its ads, they would join Apple in fighting against user tracking, because in the end, it will increase the value of its ads. The less advertisers know about the direct causal effects their ads have, the higher they will value them.</p>

    <p>Two days ago, ZDNet published this article: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ipad-as-your-work-computer-here-are-10-apps-that-make-it-possible/">Meet the iPad, your work computer: These 10 apps make real productivity possible</a>. These kinds of articles, where writers explain how they use their iPads productively, musicians talk about how the iPad is truly a professional tool, or painters show how they use the iPad for professional illustrations, are published regularly. There&#8217;s probably a new one every week.</p>

<p>Isn&#8217;t that weird?</p>

<p>The iPad is now ten years old, and people still have to write articles about how, no, really, you <em>can</em> do real work on an iPad!</p>

<p>In 1994, ten years after the Mac was originally introduced, I got my first computer, a Performa 450. Nobody wrote any articles about how, actually, real work on a Mac is possible. Everybody who had a Mac used it for real work.</p>

<p>There was no need to write articles about how you could use Macs for real work, because for Macs, it was - and still is - actually true.</p>

<hr />

<p>When Steve Jobs <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj6q_z2Ni9M">introduced the iPad</a>, he introduced it as a productivity device with an &laquo;entirely new user interface.&raquo; He called iWork on iPad &laquo;magnificent.&raquo; Schiller came on Stage and showed off Keynote, Pages, and Numbers.</p>

<p>Jobs called the iPad a car, and proclaimed that, for most people, it would replace the PC, the truck of the computing world. It would usher in the next era of personal computing.[^failure]</p>

<p>[^failure]: Some people take exception with the word &laquo;failure&raquo; in the title of this post. To be clear, when I say &laquo;failure,&raquo; I mean it in the context of this section of the article: Apple wanted the iPad to be the PC for the rest of us, and it failed to achieve that. Clearly, the iPad is making Apple money, so it&#8217;s not a failure in that sense.<br />
If you still want to yell at me about this, feel free to join the lovely people of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22180247">hacker news</a>.</p>

<p>Somehow, Apple managed to snatch a glorified graphics tablet from the jaws of the next era of personal computing.</p>

<hr />

<p>Part of the problem is the iPad&#8217;s operating system.</p>

<p>The fact that it is based on Apps as first-level objects, instead of files, is what hurts it most as a productivity device. An App-oriented user interface works well for playing games, browsing the web, and answering an email once in a while, but real work is typically file-centric.[^note] Even just writing an article means that you have collected sources like PDFs or links, images you want to include in your article, maybe spreadsheet files that contain data for a graph you want to show, a (hopefully versioned) text file for the actual body of your article, and so on.</p>

<p>[^note]: I do get that there is real work that is not file-centric. The context we&#8217;re talking about here is the one Jobs introduced, the one where the iPad replaces the PC, or at least surpasses it as the primary computing device for work. Pointing out that pilots use iPads for pre-flight checks is technically correct, and that <em>is</em> real work, but it hardly qualifies as being &laquo;the car of the computing world.&raquo;</p>

<p>This works great on a Mac, which presents a file-centric user interface, but on an iPad? It doesn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Another problem is multi-tasking, and interoperability between apps. It&#8217;s still difficult to move data between apps, and to see multiple things at once, or switch between them.</p>

<p>There are other problems with the OS, but honestly? I don&#8217;t think any of those are what <em>truly</em> hurt the iPad.</p>

<hr />

<p>The thing that truly hurts the iPad is the App Store.</p>

<p>When the original Mac came out, it didn&#8217;t have multitasking, either. But it also didn&#8217;t have an App Store. There was no gatekeeper deciding what was allowed on the Mac. So when Andy Hertzfeld <a href="https://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=Switcher.txt">wrote Switcher</a>, he knew that he could sell and distribute it.</p>

<p>Who is going to write something like Switcher for the iPad? Nobody, because it can&#8217;t get on the App Store, so it can&#8217;t be sold.</p>

<p>Who is going to write a real, truly integrated file manager for the iPad? Nobody.</p>

<p>Who is going to invest a year - or more - into creating an incredible, groundbreaking new app, the killer app, the desktop publishing equivalent for the iPad? Knowing that Apple could (and probably will) just decide to not put in the App Store, destroying all of that work?</p>

<p>Nobody.</p>

<hr />

<p>Why does this matter? It&#8217;s not that the iPad is a bad device, or that it is a problem that it only works for work-related tasks for a minority of people. But I do think that the iPad is a missed opportunity. PCs are too complicated, and the iPad could have been the car to the PC&#8217;s truck.</p>

<p>But Apple&#8217;s decisions prevented it from becoming that.</p>

<p>The contrast between Mario Kart Tour and Apple Arcade is just brutal. At which point can we all acknowledge that making mobile games was a mistake for Nintendo? I&#8217;m sure they make a ton of money, but it&#8217;s clearly coming at the cost of Nintendo&#8217;s most valuable assets: its image, the way people perceive the company, and people&#8217;s trust in Nintendo&#8217;s ability to create amazing games.</p>

  <p>I’m not sure that free-to-play games can work as ads for console games. You know, the ones where the developer’s incentive is to create a good game and get people to buy it, not the ones where the developer’s incentive is to trick people into constantly coming back to something that’s actually not very enjoyable. I’m buying Nintendo consoles exactly because I want to avoid these kinds of games.</p>
  
  <p>I have no doubt that Nintendo will make a lot of money from this, at least in the short run. I’m just not convinced that this isn’t going to do more damage than good in the long run.</p>

    <p>Remember when people said that <a href="http://ignorethecode.net/blog/2013/09/13/the_videogame_sales_cycle/">consoles were dead, and that Nintendo’s only chance for survival (and probably Apple’s only chance to get really good high-budget games on iOS) would be for Nintendo to make iPhone games</a>?</p>

<p>Well, Nintendo’s new console is <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/games/1752629/the-nintendo-switch-just-passed-a-major-sales-record">doing really well</a>,[^ps4] their good iOS game <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2017-03-24-nintendo-disappointed-by-super-mario-run-revenues">&laquo;disappointed&raquo; Nintendo</a>, while their <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/nintendo-fire-emblem-heroes-microtransactions-2017-2?r=US&amp;IR=T">shitty</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/man-spends-1-000-in-fire-emblem-heroes-still-doesnt-h-1792134459">manipulative</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/loot-boxes-are-designed-to-exploit-us-1819457592">gambling-based</a> mobile games seem to be doing well enough. And now, <a href="http://reverttosaved.com/2017/12/12/simogo-quits-iphone-and-ipad-gaming-and-points-the-finger-of-blame-at-apple/">great iOS devs are leaving the platform</a>.</p>

<p>Telling Nintendo to abandon its hardware platform for iOS was never a good idea. It doesn&#8217;t help Nintendo, and it doesn&#8217;t help iOS. There is no sustainable market on iOS for really good, non-abusive, fairly priced mid- to high-budget games, and Nintendo can&#8217;t fix that. The only company that can fix that is Apple.</p>

<p>I don’t think anyone should be surprised by any of this.</p>

<p>[^ps4]: Importantly, so is the PS4. The Xbox One is doing okay, but considering that Microsoft nowadays seems to view the Xbox as merely a platform for playing Windows games without the hassle of actually running Windows, that&#8217;s probably not particularly surprising, either.</p>

<p>NINTENDO SWITCH. Discuss.</p>

<p><strong>Lukas wrote:</strong></p>

<p>With games like Splatoon, Zelda, and that new amazing looking Mario, itâ€™s going to do better than the Wii U, but it really feels like Nintendo is snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. They donâ€™t seem to understand what makes Nintendo consoles both successful and unique. The Wii didnâ€™t sell well because it did something weird (although that helped). It sold well because when all other consoles went for online social experiences, it went for offline social experiences. Itâ€™s the console you play with friends at your house. Itâ€™s the console you play when you have people sitting next to you on the sofa.</p>

<p>The games that make Nintendo successful are games like Mario Party and Wii Bowling and Mario Kart. Games that you want to play with friends, who then want to play them with their friends because theyâ€™re so much fun.</p>

<p>The Switch fails to add anything to that experience, when it could have done something really cool: it could have introduced the ability to play offline multiplayer games and give each player secrets that their friends canâ€™t see - by giving everybody a screen.</p>

<p>Look, Iâ€™ll pick one up, and Iâ€™ll play all of the games, and Iâ€™ll have fun playing them, but unless they get amazing third-party support and people will start wanting to play these games on the Switch instead of the PS4 or Xbox One, this is not a console thatâ€™ll sell a hundred million units.</p>

<p>Combining TV and portable consoles into one was the right move, it just wasnâ€™t done ruthlessly enough. When you combine your TV console and your portable console into one, your TV experience should benefit from what portable consoles bring to the table; the portableâ€™s screen shouldnâ€™t disappear in a freaking docking station.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

<p><strong>Jon wrote:</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure I have a long email in me right now. Let&#8217;s see what happens.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re proposing that Nintendo&#8217;s success came from party games and playing with your friends. And I think it&#8217;s true that they&#8217;re great at party games. But in a pie chart that explains their success, I think you&#8217;d attribute a larger part of the pie to in-person social interaction than I would. I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s big but not the primary thing.</p>

<p>I love playing Splatoon online. I love playing Zelda all by myself. Both are possible with in-person friends, but they don&#8217;t demand it. And trust me, I&#8217;m the biggest fan of party games I know. Easily. So I get it. When Mario added ways to let a second person play in Sunshine and then in New Super Mario Brothers I just about died with happiness.</p>

<p>Now. The second screen. I am all in on the second screen. But I have two thoughts here:</p>

<ol>
<li>I&#8217;m pretty sure average users care about the secret-showing second screen far less than us</li>
<li>Designing for the second screen is a whole new thing for devs. It&#8217;s a good thing, but it adds time.</li>
</ol>

<p>And here&#8217;s a third thing:</p>

<ol start="3">
  <li>I&#8217;m fearful enough about Nintendo&#8217;s future that I&#8217;d rather they get a bit more pragmatic.</li>
</ol>

<p>So would it be cooler if the base station could power a TV separately from the tablet, opening two screen stuff? Yes. And maybe it&#8217;s still possible, I dunno. But let&#8217;s assume there&#8217;s a cost to developers designing for it, and a cost to the hardware, and that not all games will support it. None are insurmountable issues, but I&#8217;m drawn to the simplicity of &laquo;the tablet is the CPU period.&raquo;</p>

<p>And 100,000,000 units? Whatever. If it&#8217;s profitable and good, I&#8217;m ok with that. I&#8217;m suspecting it will be both. But if it&#8217;s not, Wii U tells us it&#8217;s not because of a lack of a second screen. I wouldn&#8217;t go so far as to call it a &laquo;gimmick&raquo; but people are perfectly fine without it. Even though I personally love it.</p>

<p><strong>Lukas wrote:</strong></p>

<p>Apologies for the length of this response.</p>

<p>~</p>

<p>Think of it like this: how do people decide which console to buy? Basically, I think there are three kinds of customers for consoles, and they have different kinds of approaches.</p>

<p>1: There are core gamers, who read stuff about videogames online, and know what kinds of things they like, and talk to other gamers about these things. These are the people for whom Zelda and Splatoon and Metroid are created. But in the last few generations, most of these people have gone for Microsoft and Sony consoles, not for Nintendo consoles. Nintendo could sometimes get them to also buy a Wii or a Gamecube in addition to their other console, but I think itâ€™s highly unlikely that Nintendo will truly be able to compete for these people, particularly now that theyâ€™ve given up competing on specs. The Gamecube was the last console that had a real shot at this audience, and it failed to attract many core gamers.</p>

<p>2: There are people who like playing videogames, but donâ€™t see it as part of their identity, and are only vaguely informed about whatâ€™s happening on the market. For these people, social interactions matter. Most of the people who bought a Wii bought one because they played it at a friendâ€™s place. Thatâ€™s how the console spread. I think itâ€™s easier for Nintendo to convince these people to buy a Switch, than to convert people who usually buy Sony or Microsoft consoles.</p>

<p>3: Finally, there are kids, who donâ€™t make their own buying decisions. Their parents make these decisions for them. Here, again, social interactions matter. Parents talking to each other about games theyâ€™ve experienced themselves; if youâ€™ve played Wii Bowling, the concept of giving your kid a Wii is way less scary than giving them a PS4.</p>

<p>~</p>

<p>I agree that people donâ€™t care about a second screen, but they do care about games. Hereâ€™s an example. A lot of people like playing board games, but most people play them only rarely, because you have to read the manual, set everything up, explain the rules to everybody, it just takes a lot of time to get it going. Virtual board games would be nice, but most board games only work when players can have secret information. You canâ€™t have secret information on a TV console, where everybody can see the screen.</p>

<p>How well do you think something like Settlers of Catan would do on a Nintendo console, where you play the actual game with your actual friends, but you donâ€™t have to set up the board, and donâ€™t really have to explain the rules all that well (the game guides you)? I think it might do quite well, and might actually be a reason for a lot of people to get a Switch.</p>

<p>~</p>

<p>I donâ€™t think pragmatic works for Nintendo. The N64 was pragmatic; it was a better version of the PS1. It did much worse than its predecessors, the NES and SNES. The Gamecube was pragmatic (it even had discs). It did worse than even the N64. In the context of the Wii, the Wii U was pragmatic, and it ended up being Nintendoâ€™s worst-selling console.</p>

<p>The Wii was not pragmatic, and it did well. The DS was not pragmatic, and it did well. The 3DS was not pragmatic, and itâ€™s still doing well.</p>

<p>The thing is, I think Nintendo isnâ€™t in the console business. Theyâ€™re in the toy business. And toys have to be interesting. With a toy, <a href="http://ignorethecode.net/blog/2013/09/05/lateral_thinking_with_withered_technology/">you donâ€™t care about processing power and memory</a>, you care about whether itâ€™s unique and novel and fun and whether you can talk to your friends about it.</p>

<p>To some degree, this does apply to the Switch. I donâ€™t think the Switch is a bad toy; I think itâ€™s fine. Iâ€™m looking forward to having one, and the idea of being able to play TV games on a handheld console appeals to me (thatâ€™s what I use my Vita for, streaming PS4 games).</p>

<p>The Switch isnâ€™t bad. I just think it could have been a lot more interesting.</p>

<p>~</p>

<p>About the 100 million units: the console that does the best in any given generation usually does around a 100 million units. After the Wii and the DS, this has become the way people measure Nintendoâ€™s success. The 3DS is only going to end up selling about 80 million when itâ€™s taken off the market? What a failure!</p>

<p>I agree that, from a financial point of view, selling 30 or 40 million units of the Switch would probably be okay for Nintendo, and would give them a good market for selling their games. Hell, even the Wii U probably made them some money, all things considered. It outsold the Vita quite easily, and has plenty of games that sold over (or almost) a million copies, all from Nintendo.</p>

<p>But Nintendo is a publicly traded company. &laquo;Making some money&raquo; isnâ€™t enough.</p>

<p>So my fear is not that Nintendo canâ€™t be profitable.</p>

<p>My fear is that, when the Switch &laquo;only&raquo; sells 40 million units, the people complaining about Nintendo making its own hardware instead of being a third-party software developer for Apple will effectively force Nintendo to become another Sega - to everybodyâ€™s detriment.</p>

<p><strong>Jon wrote:</strong></p>

<p>I agree with a lot of this.</p>

<p>I think everyone is always going to complain about Nintendo, regardless of how much they sell. And people like us are always going to be fearful that they&#8217;re about to disappear if they don&#8217;t get their numbers up.</p>

    <p>Late last year I created and started writing at <a href="https://anxiousrobot.net">Anxious Robot</a>, a site powered by <a href="https://medium.com">Medium</a>. My <a href="https://anxiousrobot.net/i-couldn-t-ignore-medium-7a9881b7fd04#.rdcxtnpp7">first piece there</a> explains why I decided to spin up another site after almost 15 years, and why I chose to go with Medium; the short answer is <em>convenience</em>.</p>


<p>If you’ve enjoyed my writing here over the last decade+, I’d love it if you would join me at my new endeavor. The easiest way to read the <em>Anxious Robot</em> stuff is to <a href="https://medium.com/@jblanton">follow me on Medium</a>, and read the articles either on the web or inside Medium's apps. When you do that (and you have a Medium account), you can recommend the articles you like (by tapping the heart) and thereby increase their reach, etc.</p>

    <p>Below is a list of the books I managed to power through in 2015. While I'm certain I read more in 2015 than in any other year of my life, I think the vast majority of that reading was done outside of books. I'm hoping to change that in 2016. (If interested, here's my <a href="https://neurotic.net/books">entire list of books</a>.)</p>

    <p>TL;DR: 6 Plus</p>


<p>First things first, I <em>love</em> the iPhone 6 Plus. I love it more than you do. I adore it. I’ve had it since the first day it was available and have used it 10+ hours every day since then. I work from it. A lot. It’s my favorite.</p>


<p>All of that said, a few months ago I was really itching to give the non-Plus 6 a shot, despite its inferior rear camera. Its size appealed to me for a number of reasons, and I just thought it looked and felt nice. So, I went out and bought one, used it for a few days and then…switched back to the 6 Plus. But, after a couple of days I went back to the 6. There definitely were moments when I had convinced myself that I’d keep the non-Plus and sell the Plus, but ultimately I decided that, on balance, the Plus is a better fit for me.</p>




<p>I realize some of you are looking for me to tell you which way to go, full stop, but I just can’t. They’re both great devices and at the end of the day you just have to figure out which fits your use-cases the best. </p>


<p>For me, battery is a huge deal, because I literally use the device all day long. I’ve been able to go <em>10 straight hours</em> with the Plus, just reading RSS, responding to email, Twitter, Pocket, messaging, etc.—“normal” use. The non-Plus can’t get anywhere near that number; while its battery isn’t bad, I’ve just been spoiled by the 6 Plus. It’s hard to explain the peace of mind I get from the Plus’ battery; I just <em>know</em> it’ll be available when I need it. I do the vast majority of my job these days from my iPhone, and so a bigger battery really is useful to me.</p>


<p>I also prefer how the hit targets of the keyboard on the 6 Plus are quite a bit larger due to the keys themselves being, well, larger. Because of this I can type much faster and with fewer errors on the 6 Plus. Again, for someone who uses this device as much as I do (and for a lot of mission-critical stuff), all of these efficiency gains really do start to add up.</p>


<p>Another potential differentiator is the PPI of the devices.  While the added PPI of the 6 Plus <em>is</em> noticeable (the contrast ratio is also higher on the 6 Plus), it’s just not a game-changing feature for me anymore given that once you get above 300PPI at these short distances the distinction starts to fall away. That said, the better screen of the 6 Plus definitely jumps out at you after you’ve been looking at only a 6 for a couple of days.</p>


<p>Obviously, the biggest selling point of the 6 vis-a-vis the 6 Plus is its smaller size. I found the dimensions and weight of the 6 to be nearly perfect for prolonged sessions (though those sessions are a bit shorter than those with the 6 Plus). It just feels great in hand—solid, sleek, modern. The 6 Plus can wear out my “cradling” pinky after holding it for just a little while; I often find myself changing my holding position because my hand is starting to ache or cramp. (To that end I bought a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00UY1YTGG/ref=nosim&amp;tag=justinblanton-20">PopSocket</a>, which I can’t believe I like, but I do. Yes, it’s ugly. Yes, it makes me self-conscious in public. Yes, I hate what it does to this svelte beauty. BUT, it works, and works really, really well.)</p>


<p>One final plus for the Plus is that it made me comfortable not owning an iPad. I got rid of my iPad the day I bought the 6 Plus; I just couldn’t justify having both, and well, I’m kind of militant about consolidating when I can. With the 6 though I often found myself thinking about the iPad and even ended up researching them a bit. </p>


<p>At the end of the day, the better battery on the 6 Plus is what really kept it in my hands. Even though I generally preferred the size of the 6, especially for prolonged use, there was just no getting around the fact that the 6 Plus is a workhorse.</p>

    <p>A couple of weeks ago I tweeted that I needed new mice. I had been using a <a href="https://www.razerzone.com">Razer</a> Diamondback 3G for the last eight years, and other Razer mice before then, including the original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razer_Inc.#Comparison_of_Razer_mouse_devices">Boomslang</a>. They stopped selling the Diamondback 3G a number of years ago, but I just kept buying them off of eBay. They’re very difficult to find (new) these days, and while the three I have work perfectly fine, they’re <em>disgusting</em> and probably can’t be properly cleaned at this point.</p>




<p>One of the first responses I got to the tweet mentioned above was from Twitter follower @crspence, who implored me to get a <a href="https://zowiegear.com/index.php?i=product&amp;p=19">Zowie FK1</a>. A what?! I thought for sure it was bullshit because of the name alone. I haven’t been deep into PC gaming for about 15 years, and so I had never even heard of the company. I did a little research and realized they were legit and used by lots of pro gamers.</p>




<p>After looking at their models I quickly decided on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00QIH1GD4/ref=nosim&amp;tag=justinblanton-20">FK2</a>, because it’s basically the FK1 (the one that was recommended), but ambidextrous, which means it’s symmetrical (and with my “claw grip” I only use symmetrical mice ;). The FK models are similar to the Diamondback 3G in the sense that they’re relatively small, and their tracking is <em>perfect</em> and configurable, as is the polling rate.</p>




<p>I swear, I’ve tried nearly every mouse on the planet and <em>something</em> always felt weird with the tracking (especially Bluetooth mice), and often my hand would cramp up after lengthy use. I used the FK2 for just half a day before I ordered two more—one for work and, of course, a backup. I’ll likely order a couple more at some point. I mean, I do plan on using these until at least 2030. ;)</p>

    <p>Long story, very, very short—I’ve started using <a href="https://www.karelia.com/products/the-hit-list/iphone.html">The Hit List</a> again. The what?! Yeah, <a href="https://neurotic.net/2011/06/the-hit-list-v1-0">the same THL whose developer I was so upset with in 2011</a>, because he kind of fell off the face of the earth, and development lagged and lagged and lagged. He eventually sold the app to <a href="https://www.karelia.com/">Karelia Software</a>, which has kept a steady development pace ever since.</p>


<p>My big issue with THL is that though it offers a crazy-fast sync service, it <em>doesn’t</em> encrypt your data at rest (what year is it?), and so <a href="https://neurotic.net/2012/06/omnifocus-secure-webdav">it’s not something I can use</a>. If you’re following along, that means I’m running THL only on my iPhone 6 Plus. (Semi-related: I like the iOS icon.)</p>


<p>Not being able to enter tasks from my Mac is annoying, but it’s not as bad as I thought it would be. Truth is, I do so much of my job these days from my phone, that it’s rarely even out of my hands anymore. Will I tire of the inability to enter tasks from anywhere other than my phone? Maybe, but I am really enjoying using THL again, and after installing it, I quickly remembered why it always was my favorite task management app. </p>


<p>If I do end up sticking with this iPhone-only approach, I’ll be able to futz around with all of the other task management apps that don’t offer secure syncing, e.g., <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a>, <a href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a>…basically everything <em>but</em> <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus">OmniFocus</a>.</p>

    <p>I figured this was common practice, but after seeing some co-workers’ reactions to my mentioning it, I guess maybe it isn’t? In any event, the general idea is that I use <a href="https://paypal.com">PayPal</a> whenever and wherever possible. Do I particularly like PayPal? No, but it is about as ubiquitous as internet-based payment services get (and you can pay for things with either a checking account or credit/debit card).</p>


<p>The main reason I try to concentrate payments there (especially recurring payments) is that it lessens substantially the number of services I have to update if and when my debit/credit card numbers get stolen. In the past year my card number has been stolen twice, and when that happens, as you likely know, it’s a damn pain going to the site of every service you use and changing the card number on record.</p>


<p>My process now when a card number gets stolen is 1) I add my replacement card number to PayPal and remove the old one; and 2) I reference a list I maintain of the services I pay for that don’t use PayPal, and update each of them. It’s a real time-saver.</p>

<p>Invariably, every time I post a screenshot of my iOS homescreen to Twitter, the @replies roll in fast and furious regarding the badges on many of my icons. The comments range from “Wow, how can you stand all those badges?!”, to “Wow, you’re so behind on <em>x</em>, you should just give up!”.  Nonsense, all of them.</p>
<p>The pocket computer (for the past few years I've loathed calling these things phones) is a <strong>tool</strong>.  I use it for work, play, and damn near everything in between. I’m fond of saying that these days I can do 90% of my job from this hand-held machine—it’s THE BEST. Also, I’m an information junkie and to actively not surface data that I think would be useful seems insane to me. </p>
<p>Does that mean I get notifications and badges for <em>every</em> app on my iPhone? Of course not. You’ll notice, for example, that the Mail app has no badge. Of course that’s not because there is no unread email (honestly, it’s a safe bet that each day I deal with more email than you or anyone you know), but rather because that information wouldn’t help me at all—I always know there’s a kajillion emails waiting for me. (For the record, I also don’t get <em>notifications</em> for email—work or personal—because it makes no sense to be interrupted with a small fire every 30 seconds.)</p>
<p>I’m on my iOS device 10+ hours a day. I like to be able to, at a glance, get a sense for where certain things are, and badges help me do that; I like to know what my various “queues” look like (e.g., RSS, Instapaper, Slack, messages, etc.). I don’t look at this device 1000 times a day because I have a pretty background (I do) or because I’ve rearranged my icons into a “fun” pattern (I haven’t). I look at it 1000 times a day to <em>get stuff done</em> and manage my time.</p>
<p>The iPhone is a <strong>beautiful</strong> tool, but a <em>tool</em> nonetheless. Let the machines work for you now, because soon enough we’ll be working for them.</p>
<hr />
<p>The reasons above are the same reasons why I use the “Modular” watch face on my Apple Watch, and frankly, it never even crossed my mind to use any other. The whole point of me glancing at my watch is to glean some information (above and beyond just the time), not to see how cute Mickey Mouse can look while eating up 50% of my beautiful retina display.</p></p>

    <p>The inability to sort by reading time has long been a pain point for me with <a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a>. I read more than nearly everyone—according to the stats Pocket puts out each year I read more than 99.9% of other users, and that doesn’t include <a href="https://neurotic.net/books">books!</a>—and so an easy way to auto-sort by article length (a feature <a href="https://instapaper.com">Instapaper</a> has had for a good while) would be welcomed with open arms.</p>


<p>Enter <a href="https://readruler.com/">Read Ruler</a>, which &#8220;lists your articles saved in Pocket by reading time and can also automatically add reading time tags to each article on Pocket&#8221;. It’s a brilliant solution and faster than I ever thought would be possible, especially given how large my queue is (it usually hovers between 550 and 600 articles). And yes, you can define your WPM and it will adjust its time-to-read tags accordingly. </p>


<p>One <em>almost</em> smart feature of Read Ruler is that it lets you specify tags you already use to signal to the service that articles so tagged should be filtered out of the article lists shown to you <em>at readruler.com</em>. I say  <em>almost</em> smart because I think it should go one step further and exempt entirely those tagged articles from Read Ruler analysis. The Pocket share extension on iOS lets you specify tags at save time, and so, for example, I routinely use “media” as a way of specifying that the content is a video;  even though an article is already tagged with &#8220;media&#8221;, Read Ruler still gives it a time-to-read tag as well, and so this <em>video</em> shows up in my list of 1-minute articles.</p>

    <p>I've had every generation of physical Kindle device (yes, even the DX…and I loved it) and have used every iteration of the iOS software, and still, after all of these revisions, I have a single niggle with each implementation (that doesn't exist in the other implementation).</p>


<p>In iOS I hate that I still can't <em>scroll</em> through my books. I’m instead made to page through them like it's Q12006. For whatever reason, and it may be just a feeling, I <em>feel</em> like I read faster when I scroll. (Maybe because I tend to keep my eyes focused on the same physical area of the device and scroll content through that area?)</p>


<p>With the physical devices, the thing that still really irks me is that it insists on showing the percentage of the book completed. I was hoping the Voyage would rectify this, but no dice.  <em>Amazon, no one wants to see this all of the time!</em> You've always hidden this in the iOS app, so why not here too? You hide it in the web reader as well, and the Mac app! (<strong>UPDATE:</strong> Minutes after posting this, <a href="https://twitter.com/davidixon">David Dixon</a> reached out to me on Twitter to let me know that this information can indeed be suppressed on the physical devices. On my Voyage, I simply tap the bottom left of the screen, where by default it says &#8220;Loc XXX&#8221;; tapping there cycles through the display options, including displaying <em>nothing</em>!) </p>


<p></p>

<p>All of that said, I <strong>LOVE</strong> my Kindle(s), and continue to <a href="https://neurotic.net/books">read like a crazy person</a>.</p>
